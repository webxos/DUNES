## 🌠 Project Overview

GalaxyCraft is more than just a game—it's a dynamic, ever-evolving universe where players can claim planets, build instanced sectors, engage in a thriving online economy, and craft unique items using a fun and innovative mining system. 💎 Built with a WebGPU engine, this browser-based MMO delivers stunning graphics and seamless performance, all while leveraging Web3 technologies for decentralized ownership and interaction. 🌐 The project is designed with a templated SDK, empowering game developers to build upon its foundation and create their own interstellar adventures. 🛠️

### 🌌 Key Features

- **Planet Claiming & Customization**: Players can claim up to 3 planets per account, each with customizable colors and storage capacities. 🌏 Planets serve as personal hubs for resource management and sector creation, with placeholders for future NFT integration. 🎨
- **Instanced Sectors**: Utilize a user-defined hashtag system to create sectors, each limited to 500 object grids for optimal scaling and latency. 🔗 These sectors link into a unified galaxy, offering a seamless, expansive universe accessible via 3D gateway effects. 🌉
- **Online Economy**: Dive into a universal market auction house where players can buy, sell, and trade resources and items using a virtual currency ($WEBXOS). 💰 The economy is enhanced with NFT items, adding rarity and value to the gameplay experience. 🛡️
- **Crafting & Mining System**: Engage in a rewarding crafting and mining ecosystem where resources like iron, titanium, and quantum crystals can be harvested and transformed into drones, upgrades, and more. ⛏️ This system encourages innovation and strategic planning. ⚙️
- **Real-Time Galaxy**: Explore an infinite, procedurally generated galaxy that evolves in real-time, powered by the state-of-the-art API Gateway. 🌠 This ensures a persistent world that adapts to player actions and community growth. 🌟
- **API Gateway & SDK**: The API Gateway provides a robust framework for multiplayer integration and real-time data exchange, while the templated SDK offers developers tools to extend GalaxyCraft’s WebGPU engine. 🖥️ This open-source approach fosters a collaborative ecosystem for game development. 💻

## 🎯 Vision & Mission

GalaxyCraft aims to be the ultimate destination for space exploration enthusiasts and Web3 innovators. 🌌 Our mission is to create a lightweight, accessible sandbox universe that runs efficiently in any modern browser, leveraging WebGPU for cutting-edge graphics and performance. 🎥 By open-sourcing the project, we invite the global developer community to contribute, expand, and innovate, ensuring GalaxyCraft remains a living, breathing universe. 🤝 The integration of Web3 technologies like NFTs and decentralized economies positions GalaxyCraft as a pioneer in the next generation of gaming. 🌐

### 🌍 Single-Player & Multiplayer Fallback

While GalaxyCraft is currently optimized for single-player experiences with a robust fallback system, it is designed with future multiplayer capabilities in mind. 🎮 The API Gateway serves as a placeholder for seamless integration with the GalaxyCraft MMO edition, promising a social and competitive dimension to the game. 👥
