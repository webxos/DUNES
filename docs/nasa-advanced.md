Advanced NASA Integration Guide for WebXOS 2025 Vial MCP SDK
Overview
This guide covers advanced integration of NASA Earth science tools into the WebXOS 2025 Vial MCP SDK, enhancing telescope functionality, ML visualization, orchestration, and auto-scaling.
Key Features

Telescope Processing: Leverage user PCs for NASA telescope data analysis with CUDA acceleration.
ML Visualization: Visualize NASA imagery using Three.js with ML-driven insights.
Orchestration: Chain Search, Quantum, and ML workflows for comprehensive analysis.
Auto-scaling: Dynamically scale NASA workloads based on CPU, memory, and request metrics.
Security: Ensure compliance with NASA data usage policies using JWT and rate limiting.

Installation

Update .env with NASA_API_KEY.
Build the Docker image: docker build -f build/dockerfiles/mcp-nasa.Dockerfile -t webxos-mcp-nasa:latest.
Deploy with Helm: helm install webxos ./deploy/helm/mcp-stack -f deploy/helm/mcp-stack/nasa-scaling.yaml.

Best Practices

Performance Tuning: Optimize CUDA memory usage for large NASA datasets.
Caching: Use Redis for frequent NASA data requests and SQLite for metadata.
Testing: Run pytest server/tests/test_nasa_orchestration.py to validate workflows.

Troubleshooting

API Failures: Check NASA API key and network connectivity.
Scaling Issues: Verify Kubernetes metrics in Prometheus.
Visualization Errors: Ensure Three.js and ML data compatibility.
