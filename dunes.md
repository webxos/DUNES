## Core Security Principles

### Zero-Trust MCP Architecture

Modern MCP systems must operate under the assumption that all components are potentially compromised. Our zero-trust approach implements:

- **Cryptographic Identity Verification**: Every MCP server interaction requires cryptographic proof of identity using hybrid quantum-classical signatures
- **Continuous Validation**: Real-time integrity checking of all data flows and model outputs
- **Microsegmentation**: Network-level isolation of MCP components with explicit allow-lists only

    def __init__(self):
        self.quantum_component = QiskitQuantumSigner()
        self.pq_component = DilithiumSigner()
        
    def sign(self, data: bytes) -> DUNESSignatureBundle:
        quantum_sig = self.quantum_component.sign(data)
        pq_sig = self.pq_component.sign(data)
        
        return DUNESSignatureBundle(
            data_hash=sha3_512(data),
            quantum_signature=quantum_sig,
            post_quantum_signature=pq_sig,

## AI-Specific Threat Mitigation

### Prompt Injection Defense System

DUNES introduces a multi-layered approach to prompt injection prevention:

#### 1. Semantic Analysis Gateway
```python
class DUNESPromptGuard:
    def __init__(self):
        self.jailbreak_classifier = load_fast_classifier_model()
        self.semantic_similarity = SentenceTransformer('dunes-guard-v1')
        
    def analyze_prompt(self, prompt: str) -> SecurityAnalysis:
        # Multi-vector analysis
        jailbreak_score = self.jailbreak_classifier.predict(prompt)
        similarity_scores = self.check_known_attacks(prompt)
        structural_analysis = self.analyze_structure(prompt)
        
        return SecurityAnalysis(
            risk_level=self.calculate_risk(jailbreak_score, similarity_scores, structural_analysis),
            blocked_patterns=self.identify_threats(prompt),
            recommendation=self.generate_mitigation()
        )
```

#### 2. Training Data Poisoning Detection
- **Statistical anomaly detection** on all external data sources
- **Provenance tracking** for every piece of training data
- **Real-time validation** against known-good datasets

#### 3. Model Exfiltration Prevention
- **Network policy enforcement** preventing unauthorized outbound connections
- **Output sanitization** removing model-specific artifacts
- **Differential privacy** techniques for query responses

1. **Automatic Isolation**: Kubernetes network policies sever all external connections
2. **Evidence Preservation**: Complete cluster state snapshot using Velero
3. **Alert Generation**: Multi-channel notifications to security team

#### Recovery Phase (15 minutes - 2 hours)
1. **Clean Environment Provisioning**: New cluster deployment in isolated account
2. **Cryptographic Regeneration**: All keys rotated using air-gapped quantum entropy
3. **Trusted Source Restoration**: Deployment from signed, verified artifacts only

#### The 4x Vial Agent System

Our autonomous recovery agents provide continuous operational resilience:

- **üß™ Vial of Training (Resilience)**: Automatically retrains models on clean data
- **üîç Vial of Validation (Integrity)**: Continuously audits system state against baselines  
- **‚öñÔ∏è Vial of Governance (Control)**: Manages multi-sig DAO operations during recovery
