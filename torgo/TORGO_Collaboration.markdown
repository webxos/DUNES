# TORGO and Collaboration
## Federated Research and Citizen Science

TORGO fosters global collaboration in the Glastonbury 2048 SDK by enabling federated data sharing and citizen science contributions.

### Collaboration Features
- **Federated Archiving**: Decentralized storage with AES-2048 encryption.
- **Citizen Science**: GEA_CITIZEN tags integrate TOAST platform data.
- **Interoperability**: Standardized TORGO format ensures compatibility across institutions.

### Implementation
- The `glas_astro_cli.py` CLI allows researchers to ingest and share data.
- TORGOâ€™s metadata ensures traceability and attribution for collaborative projects.

### Use Case
Citizen scientists contribute hydroponic experiment data via TOAST, archived in TORGO with GEA_CITIZEN, enabling global analysis of space agriculture.
