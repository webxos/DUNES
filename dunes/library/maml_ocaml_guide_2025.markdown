## Introduction

This guide details how xAI can leverage **Markdown as Medium Language (MAML)** with OCaml and Ortac for formally verified AI workflows. **Project Dunes** serves as the secure runtime, ensuring xAI's high-assurance requirements are met.

---

## 1. Verified MAML Workflow

MAML files integrate OCaml and Ortac for runtime verification:

1. **Submission**: xAI agents submit `.maml.md` files with OCaml code and Gospel specifications.
2. **Validation**: **Project Dunes** parses metadata and invokes Ortac to generate runtime assertions.
3. **Execution**: Dunes runs verified code in secure sandboxes.
4. **Audit**: Results and verification logs are appended to the MAML file.

## 2. MAML Schema Extension

```yaml
---
maml_version: "2.0.0"
id: "urn:uuid:987e6543-e21b-87d6-b654-426614174999"
type: "verifiable_inference"
origin: "agent://xai-agent"
verification:
  method: "ortac-runtime"
  spec_files: ["model_spec.mli"]
  level: "strict"
---
## Intent
Verify an xAI model's inference for correctness.

## Code_Blocks
```ocaml
(* model_impl.ml *)
type label = Cat | Dog | Other
let predict model features =
  (* Simplified inference logic *)
  if condition then Cat else Dog
```
```

```ocaml
(* model_spec.mli *)
type model
type label = Cat | Dog | Other
val predict : model -> float array -> label
(** @requires Array.length features = 128
    @ensures result in [Cat; Dog; Other] *)
```

---

## 3. Project Dunes Integration

**Project Dunes** automates verification:
- Parses MAML metadata and fetches `spec_files`.
- Runs `ortac wrapper` to instrument OCaml code.
- Executes in a secure OCaml sandbox, logging results.

---

## 4. Best Practices for xAI

1. **Write Specifications First**: Define Gospel `.mli` files before implementation.
2. **Use Strict Verification**: Set `verification.level: "strict"` for critical xAI workflows.
3. **Audit via History**: Leverage MAML's `History` for xAI's compliance needs.

---

## 5. Conclusion

MAML, OCaml, and **Project Dunes** enable xAI to build verified, secure AI workflows. By integrating Ortac, xAI can ensure mathematical correctness, enhancing reliability for mission-critical applications.
