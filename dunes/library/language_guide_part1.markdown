# The 2025 MAML/.mu Language Guide: Part 1 (A–C) 📚

Welcome to **Part 1** of the **2025 MAML/.mu Language Guide**, your definitive reference for building with **MAML (Markdown Agentic Markup Language)** and **MARKUP (.mu)** in the **Project Dunes 2048-AES** ecosystem! 🚀 This series is a strict, alphabetically ordered glossary for all teams using the **DUNES CORE SDK 2025** to create MCP servers, agentic workflows, and quantum-ready applications. In this part, we cover commands starting with **A–C**, detailing their syntax, use, and examples. Perfect for beginners and pros alike! 😄

## 🌟 Overview
- **MAML**: A Markdown-based language for defining executable workflows with YAML front matter and structured sections.
- **.mu**: A mirrored syntax that reverses MAML’s words (e.g., "Hello" to "olleH") and structure for self-checking receipts and recursive training.
- **Use Cases**: Workflow automation, error detection, quantum validation, and agentic recursion networks.

Let’s dive into the commands! 📝

### MAML Commands

#### `add_section`
- **Description**: Adds a new section to a MAML file, such as an objective or code block.
- **Syntax**: `add_section(section_name: str, content: List[str]) -> str`
- **Use**: Appends a new section with a header (e.g., `## Objective`) to a MAML workflow.
- **Example**:
  ```python
  from dunes_maml import DunesMAML
  maml = DunesMAML()
  section = maml.add_section("Objective", ["Train a model"])
  print(section)
  ```
  **Output**:
  ```
  ## Objective
  Train a model
  ```

#### `create_workflow`
- **Description**: Creates a complete MAML workflow with YAML front matter and sections.
- **Syntax**: `create_workflow(title: str, objective: str, code: str) -> str`
- **Use**: Generates a MAML file for defining ML pipelines or automation tasks.
- **Example**:
  ```python
  from dunes_maml import DunesMAML
  maml = DunesMAML()
  workflow = maml.create_workflow(
      title="ML Pipeline",
      objective="Train a neural network",
      code="import torch\nmodel = torch.nn.Linear(10, 1)"
  )
  print(workflow)
  ```
  **Output** (saved as `examples/ml_pipeline.maml`):
