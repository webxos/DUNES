## Abstract

This guide explores the synergy of **Markdown as Medium Language (MAML)** and OCaml, powered by **Project Dunes**, to create trustless, verifiable AI workflows for xAI. MAML's protocol and OCaml's formal verification enable xAI to build robust, secure systems.

## 1. MAML as a Computational Protocol

MAML acts as an "OAuth 2.0 for computation," delegating tasks securely via **Project Dunes**:
- **Task Owner**: xAI agent defines the MAML file.
- **Dunes Gateway**: Validates permissions and issues execution tickets.
- **Target System**: Executes xAI's AI workflows securely.

---

## 2. OCaml's Role in xAI

OCaml powers **Project Dunes**:
- **Schema Validation**: Ensures MAML file correctness.
- **Verification**: Uses Ortac for runtime assertions.
- **Sandboxing**: Runs xAI's high-assurance code securely.

```ocaml
type metadata = {
  maml_version: string;
  id: string;
  permissions: (permission * string list) list;
}
let validate_metadata m =
  (* xAI-specific validation logic *)
  Ok m
```

## 3. Project Dunes Architecture

- **Gateway**: Parses and routes MAML files for xAI.
- **Policy Engine**: Enforces xAI's security policies.
- **Quantum RAG**: Indexes MAML files for xAI's agent discovery.

---

## 4. Recommendations for xAI

1. **Build Dunes Gateway**: Implement an OCaml-based gateway for xAI's MAML workflows.
2. **Verify Critical Paths**: Use Ortac for xAI's mission-critical AI components.
3. **Standardize with MAML**: Adopt MAML as xAI's workflow format.

---

## 5. Conclusion

MAML, OCaml, and **Project Dunes** form a powerful trio for xAI, enabling trustless, verifiable, and interoperable AI systems. This symbiosis aligns with xAI's mission to accelerate scientific discovery.
