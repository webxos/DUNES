## 2. Technical Architecture Analysis

### 2.1 MCP Architecture Overview

MCP provides a standardized way for applications to share contextual information with language models, expose tools and capabilities to AI systems, and build composable integrations and workflows. The protocol uses JSON-RPC 2.0 messages to establish communication between Hosts (LLM applications), Clients (connectors), and Servers (services that provide context and capabilities).

### 2.2 MAML Architecture Enhancement

MAML extends beyond MCP's client-server model by introducing:

1. **Executable Documents**: Self-contained workflows with embedded code
2. **Formal Verification**: OCaml/Ortac integration for provably correct execution
3. **Cryptographic Security**: Quantum-resistant signatures and tickets
4. **Multi-language Support**: Native support for Python, OCaml, JavaScript, Qiskit, and Bash

## 3. Compatibility Assessment

### 3.1 MCP Integration Pathways

#### Option 1: MAML as Enhanced MCP Server
- **Implementation**: Project Dunes gateway acts as an MCP server
- **Advantages**: Immediate compatibility with existing MCP clients
- **Considerations**: May require protocol translation layer

#### Option 2: MCP-MAML Bridge Protocol
- **Implementation**: Bidirectional translation between MCP JSON-RPC and MAML documents
- **Advantages**: Preserves both protocol benefits
- **Considerations**: Increased complexity, potential information loss

#### Option 3: Native MAML with MCP Compatibility Layer
- **Implementation**: MAML-first architecture with MCP endpoints
- **Advantages**: Full MAML capabilities with MCP interoperability
- **Considerations**: Requires MCP client modifications for full feature access

### 3.2 Technical Compatibility Matrix

| MCP Feature | MAML Implementation Strategy | Effort Level | Priority |

## 4. Strategic Differentiation Analysis

### 4.1 MAML's Unique Value Propositions

#### 4.1.1 Formal Verification Integration
MAML's integration with Ortac provides mathematical guarantees about code behavior:

```ocaml
(* Example from MAML specification *)
val predict : model -> float array -> label
(** [predict m features] runs prediction on the feature vector [features].
    @requires Array.length features = 128
    @ensures the result is either Cat, Dog, or Other *)
```

**Strategic Advantage**: No existing MCP implementation offers formal verification at the protocol level.

#### 4.1.2 Multi-Language Execution Environment
MAML supports native execution of:
- Python (PyTorch, NumPy)
- OCaml (formal verification)
- JavaScript/Node.js (web3, cryptography)
- Qiskit (quantum computing)
- Bash (system operations)

**Strategic Advantage**: MCP focuses on tool invocation, while MAML enables complex, multi-stage workflows.

#### 4.1.3 Cryptographic Security Model
MAML implements:
- Quantum-resistant signatures
- Execution tickets with cryptographic guarantees
- Immutable history/audit trails
