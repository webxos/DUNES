# Legal Research Workflow
## Description
This MAML workflow orchestrates legal research tasks for the Lawmakers Suite 2048-AES. It processes case law queries using PyTorch for text analysis and Qiskit for quantum-enhanced encryption, with multi-language support (English, Spanish, Mandarin, Arabic).

## Code Blocks
### Python Analysis
```python
import torch
data = torch.tensor([[0.7, 0.2], [0.4, 0.5]], device='cuda')
result = torch.softmax(data, dim=0)
print(result)
```

### TypeScript Query Formatting
```typescript
interface LegalQuery {
    text: string;
    language: string;
    jurisdiction: string;
}
const query: LegalQuery = {
    text: "Analyze breach of contract under New York law",
    language: "en",
    jurisdiction: "NY"
};
```

## Customization
- Add language-specific queries in additional code blocks.
- Update `requires` for specific legal databases (e.g., Westlaw).
