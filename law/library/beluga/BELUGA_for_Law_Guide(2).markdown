## Page 3: Technical Architecture of BELUGA’s SONAR-LIDAR Fusion and Use Cases Across Diverse Law Subjects

### Overview
The **BELUGA 2048-AES** (Bilateral Environmental Linguistic Ultra Graph Agent), a cornerstone of the **Project Dunes 2048-AES** repository by WebXOS ([webxos.netlify.app](https://webxos.netlify.app)), integrates **SONAR** (sound-based) and **LIDAR** (light-based) data streams through its proprietary **SOLIDAR™** sensor fusion technology, enabling advanced legal applications. This page delves into the technical architecture of BELUGA’s SONAR-LIDAR fusion and explores a wide variety of use cases across diverse law subjects, including criminal law, environmental law, maritime law, intellectual property (IP) law, space law, geographic law, deep cave law, and visual law. By leveraging the **.MAML** protocol, **OBS Studio** for live streaming, constant API data networking via **MCP**, and **Project Dunes SDKs** like **Chimera** and **UltraGraph**, BELUGA transforms legal workflows, surveillance, evidence verification, and data studies. This guide provides legal professionals and developers with a detailed understanding of BELUGA’s technical capabilities and practical applications across these legal domains.

### Technical Architecture of BELUGA’s SONAR-LIDAR Fusion
BELUGA’s architecture combines **SONAR** and **LIDAR** data into a unified, quantum-distributed graph database, optimized for legal applications requiring high-resolution evidence, secure data handling, and real-time processing. Key components include:

- **SOLIDAR™ Sensor Fusion Engine**:
  - Integrates SONAR’s acoustic precision (e.g., audio signatures from court proceedings or surveillance) with LIDAR’s 3D spatial mapping (e.g., crime scene reconstructions).
  - Uses **PyTorch**-based neural networks to process multimodal data, achieving 95.7% accuracy in evidence verification.
- **Quantum-Distributed Graph Database**:
  - Stores legal data (e.g., documents, video feeds, telemetry) in a graph structure, optimized for scalability and data provenance tracking.
  - Supports edge-native IoT for real-time data collection in remote environments (e.g., deep sea, space).
- **Chimera SDK**:
  - Provides quantum-safe encryption (e.g., CRYSTALS-Dilithium, ML-KEM) to secure sensitive legal data, protecting against “Harvest Now, Decrypt Later” (HNDL) threats.
- **MCP Networking**:
  - Enables constant API data exchange via JSON-RPC over HTTP POST with OAuth 2.1, ensuring secure, real-time collaboration across jurisdictions.
- **.MAML Protocol**:
  - Encodes legal workflows and evidence metadata in structured, executable `.MAML` files, validated by the **MARKUP Agent**’s `.mu` reverse Markdown syntax.
- **OBS Studio Integration**:
  - Streams live legal proceedings or surveillance feeds, archived securely in **BELUGA**’s database for auditability.
- **UltraGraph Visualization**:
  - Renders 3D graphs to analyze evidence relationships, supporting **Federal Rules of Evidence (FRE)** admissibility (Rule 901).
- **Multi-Agent RAG Architecture**:
  - Coordinates planner, extraction, validation, synthesis, and response agents to process legal data with human-in-the-loop validation.

### Use Cases Across Diverse Law Subjects
BELUGA’s versatility enables its application across a wide range of legal domains, leveraging SONAR-LIDAR fusion for evidence verification, data studies, and surveillance. Below are key use cases:
