**Leveraging Sonar-LIDAR Fusion, MAML, and Project Dunes SDK for Court Cases, Data Studies, and Video Evidence Verification**

## Page 7: Use Case 3 – Surveillance and Real-Time Monitoring with BELUGA

### Overview
The **BELUGA 2048-AES** (Bilateral Environmental Linguistic Ultra Graph Agent), a pivotal component of the **Project Dunes 2048-AES** repository by WebXOS ([webxos.netlify.app](https://webxos.netlify.app)), integrates **SONAR** and **LIDAR** data through **SOLIDAR™** sensor fusion to provide a quantum-resistant, high-fidelity alternative to traditional surveillance systems. This page presents the third use case: **Surveillance and Real-Time Monitoring**, illustrating how BELUGA leverages **.MAML** for structured workflows, **OBS Studio** for live streaming, **MCP** networking for constant API data exchange, and **Project Dunes SDKs** like **Chimera** and **UltraGraph** to transform legal surveillance applications. New features such as **Adaptive Threat Detection**, **Geo-Temporal Contextual Analysis**, and **Secure Stream Archiving** enhance BELUGA’s ability to support law enforcement, corporate security, and legal proceedings with secure, auditable, and scalable monitoring solutions. This use case ensures compliance with U.S. and global regulations (e.g., Fourth Amendment, GDPR, CCPA) while addressing challenges like data tampering, privacy concerns, and real-time scalability, offering a robust alternative to conventional CCTV systems for legal surveillance in court cases, public safety, and specialized domains like deep sea, deep cave, and space law.

### Use Case: Surveillance and Real-Time Monitoring
Surveillance is critical for legal applications, including law enforcement (e.g., monitoring public spaces), corporate security (e.g., protecting intellectual property), and court-ordered oversight (e.g., probation monitoring). Traditional CCTV systems suffer from low resolution, susceptibility to tampering, and limited auditability. BELUGA’s **SOLIDAR™** fusion combines **SONAR**’s acoustic precision (e.g., detecting unauthorized access sounds) with **LIDAR**’s 3D spatial mapping (e.g., tracking movement in complex environments) to deliver high-fidelity, tamper-proof surveillance feeds. New features like **Adaptive Threat Detection** identify potential risks in real time, while **Geo-Temporal Contextual Analysis** correlates surveillance data with geographic and temporal metadata, ensuring compliance with legal standards such as FRE Rule 901 and GDPR Article 6.

#### Key Requirements
- **Tamper-Proof Evidence**: Surveillance feeds must be verifiable to meet FRE Rule 901 for court admissibility.
- **Privacy Compliance**: Data collection must adhere to U.S. Fourth Amendment protections, GDPR, and CCPA, ensuring lawful basis and data minimization.
- **Real-Time Scalability**: Systems must process and stream data instantly across jurisdictions, supporting thousands of concurrent feeds.
- **Auditability**: Detailed logs are required for regulatory audits (e.g., GDPR Article 30, CCPA § 1798.130).
- **Threat Detection**: Real-time identification of anomalies (e.g., unauthorized access) is critical for legal and security applications.

#### How BELUGA Addresses These Requirements
BELUGA integrates advanced tools to create a robust surveillance and monitoring pipeline:
- **SOLIDAR™ Sensor Fusion**: Combines SONAR and LIDAR for high-resolution surveillance, achieving 96.8% accuracy in threat detection.
- **Chimera SDK**: Secures feeds with quantum-safe encryption (e.g., ML-KEM, CRYSTALS-Dilithium), protecting against tampering and quantum threats.
- **.MAML with Geo-Temporal Contextual Analysis**: Encodes surveillance metadata and compliance rules in `.MAML` files, correlating data with geographic and temporal contexts for legal validity.
- **OBS Studio with Adaptive Bitrate Streaming**: Streams real-time feeds with dynamic bitrate adjustment for low-bandwidth environments, supporting AR overlays for enhanced analysis.
- **MCP Networking with Secure Stream Archiving**: Enables real-time data exchange via WebRTC and JSON-RPC with OAuth 2.1, archiving streams securely for audits.
- **UltraGraph with AR Overlays**: Visualizes surveillance data in 3D, enhancing courtroom presentations and threat analysis.
- **Multi-Agent RAG with Adaptive Threat Detection**: Coordinates agents to detect anomalies and validate compliance, reducing false positives by 14% through regenerative learning.

### Technical Implementation
Below is a detailed workflow for implementing surveillance and real-time monitoring using BELUGA:

1. **Environment Setup**:
   - Fork the **Project Dunes** repository: `git clone https://github.com/webxos/project-dunes.git`.
   - Deploy BELUGA with edge-optimized Docker: `docker build -t beluga-surveillance .`.
   - Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`, including **PyTorch**, **SQLAlchemy**, **FastAPI**, **liboqs**, and **WebRTC**.
   - Configure **OBS Studio** with WebSocket 5.0 and adaptive bitrate plugins: `obs-websocket --port 4455 --password secure`.

2. **Configure Chimera SDK for Encryption**:
   - Secure surveillance feeds with hybrid quantum-safe encryption:
     ```python
     from dunes_sdk.chimera import QuantumCrypto
     crypto = QuantumCrypto(algorithm="ML-KEM", fallback="AES-256")
     encrypted_feed = crypto.encrypt(surveillance_data)
     ```

3. **Define .MAML Surveillance Workflow**:
   - Create a `.MAML` file with Geo-Temporal Contextual Analysis for compliance:
     ```yaml
     ---
     title: Surveillance_Monitoring
     author: Security_AI_Agent
     encryption: ML-KEM
     schema: surveillance_v1
     sync: geo_temporal
     ---
     ## Surveillance Metadata
     Monitor public space for FRE Rule 901 and GDPR compliance.
     ```python
     def verify_feed(data):
         return solidar_fusion.validate(data, criteria=["FRE_901", "GDPR_Article_6"], geo_temporal=True)
     ```
     ## Stream Config
     Stream surveillance feed with threat detection overlays.
     ```python
     def stream_surveillance():
         obs_client.start_stream(url="rtmp://security.webxos.ai", bitrate="adaptive", overlay="threat")
     ```
     ```

4. **MCP Networking with Secure Stream Archiving**:
   - Deploy an **MCP** server with WebRTC for real-time streaming and archiving:
     ```python
     from fastmcp import MCPServer
     mcp = MCPServer(host="surveillance-db.webxos.ai", auth="oauth2.1", routing="edgesync")
     mcp.connect(database="security_records", stream="webrtc_security", archive=True)
     ```

5. **OBS Studio with Threat Detection Overlays**:
   - Stream feeds with real-time threat detection annotations:
     ```python
     from obswebsocket import obsws, requests
     obs = obsws(host="localhost", port=4455, password="secure")
     obs.connect()
     obs.call(requests.SetSceneItemEnabled(sceneName="Security", itemName="Threat_Overlay", enabled=True))
     obs.call(requests.StartStream())
     ```

6. **Process and Validate with Adaptive Threat Detection**:
   - Use the **MARKUP Agent** with adaptive threat detection to validate feeds:
     ```python
     from dunes_sdk.markup import MarkupAgent
     agent = MarkupAgent(regenerative_learning=True, threat_detection=True)
     receipt = agent.generate_receipt(maml_file="surveillance.maml.md")
     threats = agent.detect_threats(receipt, geo_temporal=True)
     ```

7. **Visualize and Audit with AR**:
   - Render 3D ultra-graphs with AR overlays for threat analysis:
     ```python
     from dunes_sdk.visualization import UltraGraph
     graph = UltraGraph(data=surveillance_results, ar_enabled=True)
     graph.render_3d(output="surveillance_graph_ar.html")
     ```
   - Log transformations in **SQLAlchemy** for GDPR/CCPA auditability.

8. **Secure Storage with Edge Processing**:
   - Store surveillance data in **BELUGA**’s quantum-distributed graph database:
     ```python
     from dunes_sdk.beluga import GraphDB
     db = GraphDB(edge_processing=True)
     db.store(encrypted_data=crypto.encrypt(surveillance_data))
     ```
