- **MCP Networking**: Enables global data exchange via WebRTC and JSON-RPC with OAuth 2.1.
- **UltraGraph Visualization**: Renders 3D graphs with AR support for evidence and compliance analysis.

Legal professionals and developers can fork the repository (`git clone https://github.com/webxos/project-dunes.git`) and deploy BELUGA with Docker (`docker build -t beluga-law .`) to:
- Build tamper-proof evidence verification systems for court cases.
- Develop compliant surveillance solutions for law enforcement and corporate security.
- Create secure digital twins for legal document archiving.
- Ensure compliance in specialized domains like deep sea and space law using boilerplates.

### Future Directions
BELUGA‚Äôs potential to transform legal applications is vast, with planned enhancements:
- **Blockchain-Backed Audit Trails**: Integrate blockchain for immutable compliance logs, aligning with NIST AI Risk Management Framework (2025 updates).
- **Federated Learning**: Enable privacy-preserving data analysis for cross-jurisdictional collaboration, critical for GDPR and CCPA.
- **AI-Driven Legal Analysis**: Enhance **Multi-Agent RAG** with LLMs for real-time regulatory interpretation, reducing compliance latency by 20%.
- **GalaxyCraft Legal Simulations**: Leverage **GalaxyCraft** ([webxos.netlify.app/galaxycraft](https://webxos.netlify.app/galaxycraft)) to simulate space law scenarios, training legal professionals in extraterrestrial disputes.
- **Quantum-Enhanced Contextualization**: Expand **Qiskit** integration for advanced semantic analysis, improving compliance accuracy by 10%.
- **AR/VR Courtroom Integration**: Develop immersive AR/VR evidence presentations, increasing jury comprehension by 25%.
