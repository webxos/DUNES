# Introduction to TORGO
## Purpose and Goals in Glastonbury 2048 SDK

TORGO (Terrestrially Optimized, Research-Grounded Observatory) is a data archival protocol designed to enhance the Glastonbury 2048 AES Suite SDK. Its primary goal is to create a secure, federated, and interoperable system for archiving astrobotany and quantum linguistics data, supporting space exploration and sustainable terrestrial applications.

### Objectives
- **Security**: Utilize 2048-bit AES encryption to protect sensitive research data.
- **Interoperability**: Standardize data formats for global collaboration.
- **Semantic Richness**: Use Growth Environment Anchors (GEAs) and MAML for context-aware archiving.
- **Quantum Readiness**: Integrate with Qiskit and NVIDIA CUDA for advanced analysis.

### Role in Glastonbury 2048 SDK
TORGO integrates with the SDKâ€™s astrobotany module to archive plant growth data from space environments, such as ISS microgravity experiments or Martian regolith studies. It supports quantum linguistic analysis for mission communications, enhancing data-driven insights for NASA, SpaceX, and citizen scientists.

### Why TORGO?
TORGO addresses the need for a unified archiving system in interdisciplinary space research, ensuring data integrity, accessibility, and scalability for future missions.
