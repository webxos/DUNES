# TORGO Security
## Protecting Data with 2048-bit AES

TORGO ensures data security within the Glastonbury 2048 SDK using 2048-bit AES encryption, critical for protecting sensitive astrobotany and quantum linguistic data.

### Security Features
- **Encryption**: All data payloads are encrypted with 2048-bit AES, ensuring confidentiality during storage and transfer.
- **Integrity**: Digital signatures validate data authenticity, preventing tampering.
- **Federation**: TORGO supports decentralized data sharing, allowing secure collaboration across institutions.

### Implementation
- The `bio_verifier.py` module uses quantum circuits to verify data integrity.
- Encryption keys are managed via the SDKâ€™s security protocols, ensuring compliance with space research standards.

### Use Case
Researchers archiving ISS plant growth data can trust TORGO to secure genomic sequences, preventing unauthorized access while enabling global sharing.
