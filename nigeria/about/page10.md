# Connection Machine 2048-AES üê™

*Part of PROJECT DUNES 2048-AES Humanitarian Effort*

## Introduction
The **Connection Machine 2048-AES**, inspired by Philip Emeagwali‚Äôs work, is a decentralized computational fabric designed to empower Nigerian developers. It leverages the **DUNES SDK** and **MAML protocol** to enable quantum-ready, high-performance applications for Web3, AI, and advanced computational fields.

### Key Features
- **Quadrilinear Core**: Parallel computations across four logical nodes.
- **Quantum Integration**: Qiskit-based quantum simulation.
- **MAML Support**: Structured `.maml.md` files for executable workflows.
- **NVIDIA CUDA**: Accelerated computing for AI/ML tasks.

### Getting Started
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/webxos/dunes.git`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the SDK: `npm run start`

*For more details, see the [DUNES Documentation](https://webxos.netlify.app/docs).*
