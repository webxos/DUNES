### **5. Development Roadmap: A Phased Approach to Building the Glastonbury SDK**

Given the conceptual and technical complexity of the full Glastonbury SDK, a phased development approach is essential. This roadmap prioritizes the delivery of tangible, useful functionality at each stage, leveraging current technology to de-risk the project and build towards the ultimate vision. The plan is structured into four distinct phases over a 24-month period.

#### **Phase 1: Foundational Knowledge Base & Classical Emulation (Months 1-6)**

*   **Objective:** To build the comprehensive, structured, and semantically rich knowledge base that will power all subsequent layers. This phase delivers a fully functional *classical* version of the tool, establishing immediate utility.

*   **Key Deliverables:**
    1.  **Herbal & Phytochemical Database:**
        *   Develop automated pipelines to ingest and structure data from public sources (PubChem, ChEMBL, TCMID, Dr. Duke's Phytochemical and Ethnobotanical Databases).
        *   Key data points: chemical constituents, protein targets, traditional actions, energetics (e.g., heating/cooling), contraindications.
    2.  **Classical Synergy Simulator:**
        *   Implement classical algorithms (e.g., network pharmacology analysis, similarity ensemble approach) to predict herb-herb and compound-compound interactions on a classical HPC cluster or cloud environment.
        *   This serves as the baseline against which quantum speedup/improvement will be measured.
    3.  **Druid LM (Phase 1 - Knowledge Engine):**
        *   Fine-tune a base LLM (e.g., Llama 3 or GPT-4) on the curated traditional text corpus and modern biomedical abstracts.
        *   Focus: **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**. The LM must become an expert at answering questions based on its knowledge base (e.g., "What are the traditional uses of Boswellia?"), but will not yet control workflows.
    4.  **Basic API Layer:**
        *   Release an initial Python SDK (`glastonbury-core`) with functions for data retrieval and classical synergy simulation.

*   **Success Metrics:** The Druid LM can accurately answer complex queries about herbal medicine by retrieving data from its structured knowledge base. The classical simulator can generate a plausible synergy score for a pair of herbs.

#### **Phase 2: Hybrid Quantum-Classical Integration (Months 7-12)**

*   **Objective:** To successfully offload a specific, well-defined computational sub-problem to a quantum annealer and integrate the result back into the classical workflow.

*   **Key Deliverables:**
    1.  **QUBO Formulator for Herb-Herb Pairs:**
        *   Develop and validate the mathematical framework for mapping the problem of finding the most synergistic *pair* of herbs into a QUBO problem.
        *   **Example:** For a target condition like "inflammation," the QUBO will be designed to find the pair (A,B) that maximizes joint inhibition of TNF-alpha and COX-2 while minimizing any shared toxicity profiles.
    2.  **Quantum Annealer Integration:**
        *   Integrate the SDK with the D-Wave Leap API. Build the necessary functions for job submission, monitoring, and result retrieval.
    3.  **Hybrid Orchestrator (Basic):**
        *   Develop logic to decide, for a given problem size, whether to use the classical simulator or the quantum annealer. This decision will be based on simple cost-speed-accuracy trade-offs initially.
    4.  **Validation Framework:**
        *   Rigorously compare the results from the quantum annealer against the classical baseline for the same herb-pair optimization problems. The goal is validation and characterization of performance, not necessarily quantum advantage at this stage.

*   **Success Metrics:** The SDK can automatically formulate a QUBO for a herb-pair problem, submit it to a quantum annealer, and return a result that is logically consistent with classical methods. The Druid LM can explain the *result* of the quantum computation in the context of the user's query.

#### **Phase 3: Dynamic Context Protocol Activation (Months 13-18)**

*   **Objective:** To elevate the Druid LM from a knowledge engine to an intelligent orchestrator, enabling it to dynamically control the quantum-classical workflow based on real-time reasoning.

*   **Key Deliverables:**
    1.  **Druid LM (Phase 2 - Orchestrator):**
        *   Implement advanced prompt engineering and agency frameworks (e.g., using LangChain or similar) to allow the LM to break down a high-level user goal into a sequence of executable steps for the Orchestrator.
        *   The LM now generates the parameters for the QUBO Formulator based on its semantic understanding of the query.
    2.  **"Quantum Mesh" Routing Logic:**
        *   Enhance the Orchestrator to make sophisticated routing decisions. It can now:
            *   Split a large QUBO problem (e.g., for a 5-herb formula) into smaller sub-problems solvable on current annealers.
            *   Decide to run multiple candidate QUBOs in parallel on different quantum processors (via different cloud providers).
            *   Dynamically fall back to classical solvers based on quantum hardware availability or error rates.
    3.  **Advanced Explanation System:**
        *   The Druid LM's explanation capability is enhanced to include its own reasoning process for orchestrating the workflow, building greater user trust.

*   **Success Metrics:** A user can ask a complex, open-ended question, and the Druid LM can autonomously generate and execute a plan to compute an answer using a hybrid combination of classical and quantum resources, providing a coherent explanation of the entire process.

#### **Phase 4: Refinement, Scaling, and Beta Release (Months 19-24)**

*   **Objective:** To scale the system to handle the full complexity of polyherbal formulae, optimize for performance and cost, and prepare for a limited external beta release.

*   **Key Deliverables:**
    1.  **Polyherbal Formulae Optimization:**
        *   Extend the QUBO formulation and Orchestrator logic to handle formulae with 5 or more herbs, representing the true complexity of traditional medicine.
    2.  **Performance & Cost Optimization:**
        *   Profile the entire stack to identify and eliminate bottlenecks, particularly in data serialization and quantum job overhead.
        *   Implement caching, memoization, and cost-tracking features.
    3.  **Beta SDK Release (`glastonbury`):**
        *   Package the refined SDK for distribution.
        *   Onboard a select group of academic and industry partners for real-world testing and validation.

*   **Success Metrics:** The SDK can reliably and cost-effectively generate and explain novel, complex polyherbal formulae that adhere to traditional principles and modern pharmacological constraints, ready for further validation in clinical settings.
