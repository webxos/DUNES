### **4.4 Layer 4: The API & Abstraction Layer (The Glastonbury API) - The Practitioner's Portal**

*   **Purpose:** To provide an intuitive, accessible, and safe interface for end-users—researchers, pharmacognosists, and forward-thinking practitioners—shielding them from the underlying complexity of the quantum-classical-LLM stack. The API embodies the principle that the most powerful technology is that which disappears into the background, allowing the user to focus on their domain expertise.

*   **Implementation with Current Technology (2025):**
    *   **Language & Framework:** A **Python-first** library, distributed via PyPI, ensuring ease of integration into existing scientific computing workflows (e.g., Jupyter Notebooks). A complementary REST API will be provided for integration with web applications and other programming languages.
    *   **Core Design Philosophy:** The API will offer multiple levels of abstraction, from high-level natural language prompts to precise programmatic control, catering to different user expertise.

#### **Key API Functions and Endpoints:**

**1. Natural Language Interface:**
This is the most accessible layer, directly leveraging the Druid LM.
```python
# Example 1: High-level natural language query
response = glastonbury.query(
    "Explain the potential synergy between Ashwagandha and Turmeric for managing stress-induced inflammation, and suggest a starting ratio."
)

# Example 2: Formula analysis and modernization
report = glastonbury.analyze_formula(
    formula_name="Classic Adaptogenic Blend",
    herbs=["Withania somnifera", "Curcuma longa", "Glycyrrhiza glabra"],
    query="Optimize this formula for bioavailability and suggest a companion herb for improved cognitive effect."
)
```

**2. Core Formula Management & Simulation:**
These functions handle the primary work of formula interaction and creation.
```python
# Example 3: Creating a simulation domain based on a patient's pattern
patient_pattern = {
    "primary_pattern": "Liver Qi Stagnation",
    "secondary_patterns": ["Spleen Qi Deficiency"],
    "contraindications": ["hypertension", "pregnancy"]
}

simulation = glastonbury.SimulationDomain(
    pattern=patient_pattern,
    goal="generate harmonizing formula"
)

# Example 4: Running a hybrid quantum-classical simulation
# The 'auto' setting allows the Druid LM and Orchestrator to select the best solver
results = simulation.run_hybrid_simulation(
    solver_selection="auto",
    exploration_intensity="high" # Configures the QUBO search space size
)

# Example 5: Inspecting the results
optimal_formula = results.get_optimal_formula()
synergy_score = results.synergy_metrics
explanation = results.get_llm_explanation()
```

**3. Knowledge Base Interaction:**
These endpoints allow users to interrogate the SDK's vast integrated knowledge graph.
```python
# Example 6: Querying the semantic knowledge graph
herb_info = glastonbury.get_herb("Salvia miltiorrhiza")
print(herb_info.traditional_uses) # Output: ['Invigorate blood', 'Reduce stasis', 'Clear heat']
print(herb_info.primary_targets) # Output: ['ACE', 'TNF-alpha', 'COX-2']

# Example 7: Finding herbs by property
cooling_herbs = glastonbury.search_herbs(property="cooling", strength="strong")
blood_herbs = glastonbury.search_herbs(traditional_function="invigorate blood")
```

**4. Safety and Validation:**
A critical module to ensure any generated formula is vetted against known pharmacological data.
```python
# Example 8: Safety screening
toxicity_report = glastonbury.safety_screen(
    formula=optimal_formula,
    health_conditions=patient_pattern["contraindications"]
)

if toxicity_report.passes:
    print("Formula is predicted to be safe.")
else:
    print(f"Potential interactions: {toxicity_report.warnings}")
```

#### **Practical Workflow Example:**

A user, a researcher studying Ayurvedic formulations for metabolic health, would interact with the SDK as follows:

1.  **Initiate:** `import glastonbury as gb`
2.  **Explore:** Use `gb.search_herbs()` and `gb.get_herb()` to define their botanical space of interest (e.g., herbs with `hypoglycemic` properties).
3.  **Define:** Create a `SimulationDomain` with the goal `"optimize_for_insulin_sensitivity"` and constraints to avoid `"hepatic_stress"`.
4.  **Execute:** Call `simulation.run_hybrid_simulation()`. The SDK transparently handles the entire process: the Druid LM defines the problem, the Orchestrator formulates the QUBO and selects a quantum processor, and the results are post-processed.
5.  **Analyze:** Review the `optimal_formula` (e.g., a novel combination of *Gymnema sylvestre*, *Berberis aristata*, and *Curcuma longa* at a specific ratio), study the `synergy_score`, and read the AI-generated `explanation` justifying the proposal based on both traditional *rasa* (taste) and modern AMPK pathway activation.
6.  **Validate:** Run a `safety_screen()` to check for potential herb-drug interactions before proceeding to *in vitro* testing.

This API layer completes the technical stack, transforming the formidable underlying architecture into a usable and powerful tool for discovery. The following section will detail the development roadmap to bring this vision to reality.
