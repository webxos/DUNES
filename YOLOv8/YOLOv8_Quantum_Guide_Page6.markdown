### Aerial Pothole Patrol: Autonomous Detection with PX4 and MCP

Drones (e.g., DJI Mavic with a companion computer like NVIDIA Jetson Nano) enable overhead pothole scanning for rural or urban roads. This page integrates YOLOv8 with **DroneKit/MAVLink** for waypoint-based detection, leverages the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** for verifiable workflows, and streams results to OBS for real-time monitoring, aligning with smart city or insurer use cases.

#### Step 1: Drone Hardware and Software Setup
- **Hardware**: Drone with camera (e.g., DJI Mavic Mini); companion computer (NVIDIA Jetson Nano or Raspberry Pi 4 for edge GPU/CPU).
- **Software**: 
  - Install **ArduPilot** or **PX4** for flight control.
  - Use **ROS2** (Robot Operating System) for MCP agent orchestration.
  - Install dependencies: `pip install dronekit ultralytics opencv-python mavsdk`.

#### Step 2: YOLOv8 Drone Pipeline
Deploy the TensorFlow Lite YOLOv8 model and control drone navigation with DroneKit for autonomous pothole detection.

```python
from dronekit import connect, VehicleMode, LocationGlobalRelative
from ultralytics import YOLO
import cv2
import numpy as np

# Connect to drone (replace with your serial port or SITL for simulation)
vehicle = connect('/dev/ttyUSB0', wait_ready=True, baud=57600)  # Or 'tcp:127.0.0.1:5760' for SITL
model = YOLO('best.tflite')  # Lightweight model from Page 5

def arm_and_takeoff(target_altitude):
    print("Arming and taking off...")
    vehicle.mode = VehicleMode("GUIDED")
    vehicle.armed = True
    while not vehicle.armed:
        print("Waiting for arming...")
    vehicle.simple_takeoff(target_altitude)
    while vehicle.location.global_relative_frame.alt < target_altitude * 0.95:
        print(f"Altitude: {vehicle.location.global_relative_frame.alt}")
    print("Reached target altitude")

def get_drone_frame():
    # Simulate camera feed (replace with GStreamer/ROS topic for real drones)
    cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)  # Or ROS topic: /camera/image_raw
    ret, frame = cap.read()
    cap.release()
    return frame if ret else None

# MCP-Integrated Detection Loop
def detect_potholes():
    arm_and_takeoff(10)  # Takeoff to 10m above ground level
    while True:
        frame = get_drone_frame()
        if frame is None:
            continue
        
        # Run YOLOv8 inference
        results = model(frame)
        
        # MCP Validator: Filter high-confidence detections
        potholes = [box for box in results[0].boxes if box.conf > 0.7]
        
        if potholes:
            # Hover at current position
            vehicle.simple_goto(vehicle.location.global_relative_frame)
            # Log to MCP and publish alert
            payload = {
                "context": "drone_pothole_scan",
                "gps": str(vehicle.location.global_frame),
                "potholes": len(potholes),
                "confidences": [box.conf.item() for box in potholes]
            }
            # Publish to MQTT or OBS (see Page 4)
            print(f"Pothole detected: {payload}")
        
        # Stream annotated frame to OBS
        cv2.imshow('Drone View', results[0].plot())
        cv2.waitKey(1)

# Execute mission
try:
    detect_potholes()
except KeyboardInterrupt:
    vehicle.mode = VehicleMode("RTL")  # Return to launch
vehicle.close()
```

#### Step 3: OBS and MCP Integration
- **OBS Streaming**: Use Page 4â€™s WebSocket setup to overlay GPS and pothole data on live drone feeds. Configure OBS with a Browser Source to pull from `/ws/detections`.
- **MCP Logging**: Store detections in SQLite for auditability, embedding GPS metadata in `.maml.md`:

```markdown
---
mcp_schema: yolo_drone_pothole
version: 1.0
device: drone_px4
---
# Drone Pothole Detection
## Context
- Stream: RTMP to OBS
- Confidence Threshold: 0.7
- GPS: {latitude, longitude, altitude}
```

- **FAA Compliance**: Implement geofencing via MAVLink commands; log flights in MCP schema for regulatory audits.

**Metrics**: 20+ FPS at 1080p on Jetson Nano; 90% detection accuracy for potholes >0.7 confidence. Latency: <150ms for MQTT/OBS streaming over 4G.

**Use Case**: Autonomous pothole surveys for municipalities; integrate with insurers for claim validation (e.g., $26.5B U.S. pothole damage mitigation).

**Pro Tip**: For noisy aerial feeds, flag frames for quantum denoising with Chimera (Page 8). Simulate missions using ArduPilot SITL before field deployment.
