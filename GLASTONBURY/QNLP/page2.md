# QNLP Library Architecture: A Modular Ecosystem for Quantum-Classical NLP Integration

## Overview
This document outlines the architectural design of an open-source library ecosystem for Quantum Neuro-Linguistic Programming (QNLP), built around the Model Context Protocol (MCP). The library is structured as a collection of GitHub repositories, each serving a distinct role in enabling hybrid quantum-classical NLP systems. The ecosystem standardizes communication between quantum and classical components, lowering the barrier for researchers to explore quantum-enhanced NLP.

## Core Components

### 1. Core MCP Library (qnlp-mcp-core)
**Purpose**: Implements the core Model Context Protocol logic for standardized communication between quantum and classical NLP components.

**Functionality**:
- **Context Serialization**: Serializes/deserializes complex data structures, including quantum states, using JSON-RPC 2.0 for interoperability.
- **Session Management**: Manages context-aware sessions, handling interruptions and maintaining state across multi-step workflows.
- **Tool Dispatcher**: Routes MCP client requests to appropriate servers based on required tools or resources.

**Dependencies**: JSON-RPC 2.0, Python (for implementation), and standard networking libraries.

### 2. Quantum Information Server (qnlp-quantum-server)
**Purpose**: Specialized MCP server for quantum information processing tailored to NLP tasks.

**Dependencies**: Quantum SDKs (Lambeq, Qiskit).

**Key Functionality**:
- **Quantum Embedding Tool**: Converts classical word embeddings into parameterized quantum circuits for encoding linguistic information.
- **DisCoCat Compiler**: Compiles grammatical structures (e.g., DisCoCat diagrams) into executable quantum circuits.
- **Quantum State Analysis Tool**: Measures quantum states to extract linguistic features, such as resolving lexical ambiguity through entanglement measurements.

### 3. Hybrid Engine Server (qnlp-hybrid-server)
**Purpose**: Orchestrates communication between classical and quantum components for hybrid NLP workflows.

**Dependencies**: Classical NLP libraries (Hugging Face Transformers, Flair, Spark NLP), quantum frameworks (Lambeq, Qiskit).

**Key Functionality**:
- **Classical Pre-processing Tool**: Uses classical models (e.g., BERT) for tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, and other pre-processing tasks.
- **Quantum Enhancement Tool**: Identifies computationally intensive tasks and delegates them to the quantum server for processing.
- **Result Integration Tool**: Combines quantum and classical results to produce coherent, context-aware outputs.

### 4. Context-Aware Agent Framework (qnlp-agent-sdk)
**Purpose**: Provides a high-level SDK for building complex, multi-step QNLP applications.

**Dependencies**: qnlp-mcp-core, agent frameworks (LangChain, LlamaIndex).

**Key Functionality**:
- **Agentic Workflows**: Supports complex tasks like text generation based on quantum-computed semantic relationships.
- **Prompt Management**: Retrieves specialized prompts to activate quantum or hybrid workflows via MCP servers.
- **Secure Execution**: Provides guides for secure data handling and user permission management.

## Research and Development Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundational Development (Months 1–6)
- Develop qnlp-mcp-core with robust MCP specification adherence.
- Build initial qnlp-quantum-server and qnlp-hybrid-server with basic functionalities (quantum embedding, simple circuit compilation).
- Publish reference implementations for basic QNLP tasks (e.g., text classification).

### Phase 2: Advanced Feature Integration (Months 6–18)
- Enhance quantum tools:
  - Develop entanglement-aware models for complex linguistic dependencies.
  - Implement quantum optimization algorithms (e.g., QAOA) for NLP tasks.
- Demonstrate dynamic hybrid workflows combining classical and quantum components.
- Benchmark performance against classical state-of-the-art models, noting current hardware limitations.

### Phase 3: Community and Application Growth (Months 18+)
- Encourage open-source contributions through active community engagement.
- Develop real-world applications:
  - Biomedical text mining for extracting complex relationships.
  - Semantic search using quantum-computed similarities.
- Refine MCP based on quantum integration needs, collaborating with the broader MCP community.

## Conclusion
This modular, open-source QNLP library ecosystem, centered around MCP, provides a standardized framework for integrating quantum and classical NLP systems. By lowering technical barriers and fostering collaboration, it aims to accelerate research and push the boundaries of quantum-enhanced natural language processing.
