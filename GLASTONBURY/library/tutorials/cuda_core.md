## Abstract

The GLASTONBURY 2048 SUITE SDK, powered by the CHIMERA 2048 API Gateway
and NVIDIA technologies, integrates quantum computing to revolutionize medical diagnos-
tics, drug discovery, genomics, imaging, radiotherapy, personalized medicine, data security,
clinical decision-making, medical training, and telemedicine. This manual provides a de-
tailed guide for medical libraries and research institutions to deploy and utilize the SDK,
ensuring enhanced precision and security in healthcare applications.

## 1 Introduction
The GLASTONBURY 2048 SUITE SDK leverages the CHIMERA 2048 API Gateway, a
quantum-enhanced platform, to address the computational demands of modern medical re-
search. Built on NVIDIA’s GB200 NVL72 systems, CUDA-Q, and TensorRT, it offers a
secure, scalable solution for processing medical data. This manual outlines installation,
configuration, and application-specific use cases, tailored for medical libraries and clinical
offices.

## 2 System Architecture
The GLASTONBURY 2048 SUITE SDK operates as a modular pipeline:
• Input Layer: Ingests medical data (e.g., MRI, genomic sequences) via secure proto-
cols.
• Quantum Processing Layer: Utilizes NVIDIA CUDA-Q and TensorRT for quantum
algorithms on CHIMERA hardware.

1
• Output Layer: Delivers processed results (e.g., diagnostic reports, treatment plans)
with 2048-bit quantum encryption.
