6. Integration with MAML and Project Dunes
Descriptive Text: This section details the integration of the Quantum Herbal Medicine SDK with the Markdown as Medium Language (MAML) protocol and Project Dunes, creating a robust framework for orchestrating quantum, classical, and AI-driven workflows. Inspired by Dr. George Washington Carver’s systematic and reproducible experimentation with plant-based compounds, such as peanut-derived medicinal oils, this integration ensures secure, verifiable, and accessible computational pipelines. Leveraging technologies from the provided documents—Qiskit, PyTorch, NVIDIA CUDA, and OCaml-based verification—the SDK uses MAML and Project Dunes to encapsulate and execute workflows, mirroring Carver’s commitment to rigorous, community-focused science.
Dr. Carver’s legacy is rooted in his meticulous approach to experimentation, where he documented and shared findings to empower farmers. His structured methods—testing multiple plant derivatives and cataloging their properties—are reflected in the SDK’s use of MAML to encapsulate intent, data, code, and verification logic in executable .maml.md files (see mamllanguageguide.md). Project Dunes, with its OCaml-based runtime and Ortac verification (see mamlocamlguide.md, project_dunes_maml_research_2025.md), ensures that these workflows are secure and reproducible, aligning with Carver’s ethos of accessibility and scientific integrity.
MAML Workflow Orchestration

Purpose: Encapsulate quantum simulations, AI analysis, and classical computations in a unified, human-readable format, echoing Carver’s clear documentation of experiments.  
Implementation: 
MAML files define workflows with YAML front matter specifying dependencies (e.g., Qiskit, PyTorch, Grok 3 API) and verification requirements (e.g., Gospel specifications).  

Each file includes sections for intent (e.g., “Optimize extraction of quercetin”), context (e.g., constraints like temperature or solvent), and code blocks (e.g., quantum circuits or AI prompts).  

Example MAML File:

## Intent
Optimize extraction of arachidic acid from peanut oil, inspired by Carver’s medicinal oil work.

## Context
compound: arachidic_acid
source: peanut_oil
target_yield: 95%
constraints: { temperature: [20, 60], solvent: ["ethanol", "hexane"] }

## Code_Blocks
```python
from dwave.system import DWaveSampler, EmbeddingComposite

Q = {...}  # QUBO matrix for extraction optimization
sampler = EmbeddingComposite(DWaveSampler())
response = sampler.sample_qubo(Q, num_reads=1000)
print(f"Optimal conditions: {response.first.sample}")

2025-09-01T16:05:00Z: [CREATE] File instantiated by carver-agent.
2025-09-01T16:06:00Z: [VERIFY] Specification herbal_spec.mli validated.






Carver Connection: Mirrors Carver’s structured documentation, ensuring workflows are reproducible and accessible to researchers, as his Jesup Wagon made knowledge accessible to farmers.

Project Dunes Integration

Purpose: Validate and execute MAML workflows in secure sandboxes, reflecting Carver’s commitment to reliable experimentation.  
Implementation: 
The Dunes runtime, built on OCaml, validates MAML files against Gospel specifications using Ortac (see mamlocamlguide.md).  
Workflows are executed in isolated environments, with results logged in the History section for auditability (see project_dunes_maml_research_2025.md).  
Supports dynamic allocation of quantum resources (e.g., D-Wave Leap, IBM Quantum) and AI tasks via Grok 3 API (see jupyter-notebooks.md).


Carver Connection: Ensures scientific rigor, akin to Carver’s methodical testing, by verifying computational steps against formal specifications.

Benefits of Integration

Reproducibility: MAML’s structured format ensures workflows can be replicated, as Carver’s experiments were repeatable.  
Security: Project Dunes’ verification prevents errors, safeguarding research integrity.  
Accessibility: Open-source MAML templates enable global collaboration, echoing Carver’s community-focused approach.
