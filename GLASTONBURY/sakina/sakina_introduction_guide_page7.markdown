   - Create a custom MAML workflow in `sdk/templates/emergency_response.yaml`:
     ```yaml
     name: Volcanic Rescue
     context:
       type: emergency_response
       solidar: true
       bluetooth_mesh: true
     actions:
       - map_terrain: volcanic_region
       - track_assets: airtag_123
       - analyze_health: neuralink_data
       - archive: maml_artifact
     ```

3. **Integrate SOLIDAR‚Ñ¢**:
   - Modify `sakina/solidar.go` to process SONAR and LIDAR data:
     ```go
     package sakina

     import "github.com/webxos/glastonbury-sdk/beluga"

     func ProcessSOLIDAR(terrain string) {
         beluga.MapTerrain(terrain, beluga.WithSONAR(true), beluga.WithLIDAR(true))
     }
     ```

4. **Deploy with Docker**:
   ```bash
   docker build --build-arg CUDA_VERSION=12.2 -t custom-sakina .
   docker run --gpus all --network tor -p 8000:8000 -e GLASTONBURY_API_KEY=your_key custom-sakina
   ```

5. **Verify Workflow**:
   - Use OCaml to ensure reliability:
     ```bash
     ocaml sdk/verify/verify.ml volcanic_rescue.ml
     ```
