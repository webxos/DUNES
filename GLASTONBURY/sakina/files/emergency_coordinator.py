# emergency_coordinator.py
"""
Emergency coordination module for SAKINA to manage real-time crisis response.
Integrates Bluetooth mesh for asset tracking and SOLIDAR™ for environmental mapping.
Secured with 2048-bit AES encryption and OAuth 2.0.
Use Case: Coordinate a Martian habitat evacuation during a life-support failure.

        - Requires sakina_client.py and bluetooth_mesh.py in the same directory.
        - Install dependencies: `pip install glastonbury-sdk`.
        - Ensure SOLIDAR™ hardware is configured for environmental mapping.
        - For LLM scaling, integrate with llm_integration.py for automated alerts.
