# data_federation.py
"""
Data federation module for SAKINA to enable secure interplanetary research collaboration.
Aggregates data from multiple sources while preserving privacy.
Secured with 2048-bit AES encryption and TORGO archival.
Use Case: Share medical research data between Earth and Mars without compromising privacy.
