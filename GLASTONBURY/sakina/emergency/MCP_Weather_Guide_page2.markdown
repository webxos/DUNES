### SAKINA: The Adaptive Intelligence Core
SAKINA is a multi-agent AI system built on the **PyTorch-SQLAlchemy-FastAPI** stack, designed to operate within the **PROJECT DUNES 2048-AES** ecosystem. Its name, inspired by the concept of adaptive serenity in crisis, reflects its ability to remain calm and effective under pressure, much like a seasoned nurse or engineer. SAKINA‚Äôs architecture is inherently modular, allowing it to "wrap" itself into niche roles‚Äîmedical triage coordinator, infrastructure repair strategist, or logistics optimizer‚Äîbased on situational requirements. This adaptability is powered by the **.MAML (Markdown as Medium Language)** protocol, which enables SAKINA to process and generate structured, executable data containers for real-time decision-making. By integrating with the **HIVE weather database**, SAKINA accesses a global stream of atmospheric and terrestrial data, ensuring its responses are grounded in the latest environmental intelligence.

#### SAKINA in Action: Nurse and Engineer Modes
- **Nurse Mode**: In a flood scenario, SAKINA processes real-time data from the HIVE database to identify high-risk areas, prioritize medical evacuations, and coordinate resource allocation (e.g., medical supplies, ambulances). It uses **GIS integration** to map safe routes for rescue teams and provides real-time updates on victims‚Äô medical conditions, leveraging smartphone apps for crowd-sourced health data.[](https://www.fundsforngos.org/proposals/an-example-sample-project-proposal-on-developing-mobile-applications-for-real-time-disaster-alerts-emergency-communication-and-relief-coordination/)
- **Engineer Mode**: During a hurricane, SAKINA assesses infrastructure damage using subterranean sensor data and satellite imagery, generating repair plans and shutdown scripts to stabilize critical systems like power grids or bridges. It coordinates with UAV swarms to deliver supplies and uses **Bluetooth mesh** to maintain connectivity in disrupted areas.[](https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/16/23/10730)
