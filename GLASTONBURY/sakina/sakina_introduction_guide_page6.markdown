## üîí SAKINA‚Äôs Secondary Network Layer: Verification and Security

SAKINA introduces a custom secondary network layer to enhance Bluetooth mesh, providing robust security and verification for decentralized communication. This layer integrates **2048-bit AES encryption**, **OAuth 2.0**, and **MCP**, ensuring secure, verifiable, and context-aware data exchange.

### Components of the Secondary Network Layer
1. **2048-bit AES Encryption**:
   - **Purpose**: Secures Bluetooth mesh data with quantum-resistant cryptography.
   - **Implementation**: Uses CRYSTALS-Dilithium signatures for post-quantum integrity.
   - **Use Case**: Encrypts Neuralink health data transmitted via Bluetooth mesh.

2. **OAuth 2.0 Authentication**:
   - **Purpose**: Restricts access to authorized devices and users with biometric verification (fingerprint, iris, facial recognition).
   - **Use Case**: Authenticates an Apple Watch user accessing SAKINA‚Äôs medical services in a clinic.

3. **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**:
   - **Purpose**: Encodes context-aware workflows as MAML (.maml.md) artifacts, enabling intelligent data routing and verification.
   - **Benefit**: Enhances Bluetooth mesh with semantic richness, ensuring accurate data interpretation.
   - **Use Case**: Routes emergency repair instructions to a specific device in a mesh network.

4. **MAML and Markup (.mu) Artifacts**:
   - **Purpose**: Creates executable, verifiable records of network transactions.
   - **Format**: MAML encodes data and context; Markup (.mu) provides reversed receipts (e.g., ‚ÄúData‚Äù to ‚ÄúataD‚Äù) for self-checking.
   - **Use Case**: Archives Bluetooth mesh communications as auditable artifacts via TORGO.

5. **Tor Integration**:
   - **Purpose**: Anonymizes Bluetooth mesh data when synced with external networks.
   - **Use Case**: Protects patient data privacy during transmission from a remote clinic.
