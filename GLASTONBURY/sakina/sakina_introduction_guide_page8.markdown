## üõ†Ô∏è Building Custom SDKs with SAKINA‚Äôs Guidance

SAKINA‚Äôs Teacher Mode empowers users to build custom SDKs using the Glastonbury 2048 AES Suite SDK, leveraging the GitHub repository as a source for templates, tutorials, and code. The process is secured by 2048-bit AES encryption and supported by TORGO and the Hive Network for verifiable, scalable builds.

### Steps to Build a Custom SDK
1. **Access the GitHub Repository**:
   - Clone the repository:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/webxos/glastonbury-2048-sdk.git
     cd glastonbury-2048-sdk
     ```

2. **Explore Educational Resources**:
   - **Directory**: `docs/tutorials/` contains MAML-based tutorials for medical and aerospace applications.
   - **Example Tutorial**: `tutorials/medical_diagnostic.maml.md` guides users through building a diagnostic workflow.
     ```markdown
     ## Medical Diagnostic Tutorial
     ### Context
     - Type: Healthcare
     - Objective: Build a Neuralink diagnostic workflow
     ### Steps
     1. Fetch Neuralink data
     2. Analyze with CUDA
     3. Archive as MAML artifact
     ### Code
     ```go
     client := sakina.NewClient("your_api_key")
     data := client.FetchNeuralData("patient_123")
     analysis := client.Analyze(data, sakina.WithCUDA(true))
     ```
     ```

3. **Use Templates**:
   - Copy templates from `sdk/templates/` (e.g., `aerospace_repair.yaml` or `emergency_response.yaml`).
   - Modify using SAKINA‚Äôs Teacher Mode guidance:
     ```yaml
     name: Custom Emergency Response
     context:
       type: emergency_response
       solidar: true
       neuralink: true
     actions:
       - map_terrain: martian_surface
       - fetch_health_data: neuralink_123
       - archive: maml_artifact
     ```

4. **Interact with SAKINA**:
   - Query SAKINA for code assistance:
     ```bash
     curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/sakina/teacher -d '{"query": "How to add SOLIDAR to a rescue workflow?"}'
     ```
   - SAKINA responds with code snippets and explanations, encrypted with 2048-bit AES.

5. **Build and Deploy**:
   - Build Docker image:
     ```bash
     docker build --build-arg CUDA_VERSION=12.2 -t custom-sakina .
     ```
   - Run with secure network:
     ```bash
     docker run --gpus all --network tor -p 8000:8000 -e GLASTONBURY_API_KEY=your_key custom-sakina
     ```

6. **Verify Builds**:
   - Use OCaml verification tools:
     ```bash
     ocaml sdk/verify/verify.ml custom_workflow.ml
     ```
