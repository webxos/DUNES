### Example: Custom Repair Workflow
```go
package main

import (
    "github.com/webxos/glastonbury-sdk/sakina"
    "github.com/webxos/glastonbury-sdk/torgo"
)

func main() {
    client := sakina.NewClient("your_api_key")
    torgoClient := torgo.NewClient("tor://glastonbury.onion")

    // Load starship schematic
    schematic := client.LoadSchematic("starship_thruster")

    // Analyze with CUDA and SOLIDAR‚Ñ¢
    analysis := client.AnalyzeSchematic(schematic, sakina.WithCUDA(true), sakina.WithSOLIDAR(true))

    // Generate repair plan
    repairPlan := client.GenerateRepairPlan(analysis)

    // Archive as MAML artifact
    artifact := torgo.CreateMAMLArtifact("starship_repair_123", repairPlan)
    torgoClient.Archive(artifact)

    // Generate Markup (.mu) receipt
    receipt := torgo.CreateMarkupReceipt(artifact)
    torgoClient.StoreReceipt(receipt)
}
```

This workflow loads a starship schematic, analyzes it with CUDA and SOLIDAR‚Ñ¢, generates a repair plan, and archives the results securely.
