# MAML and Collaboration
## Federated Research with TORGO

MAML and TORGO enable federated research in the Glastonbury 2048 SDK, supporting global collaboration for astrobotany and quantum linguistics.

### Collaboration Features
- **MAML Workflows**: Define shareable tasks with standardized schemas.
- **TORGO Archiving**: Uses GEA_CITIZEN for citizen science contributions.
- **Federated Storage**: Decentralized TORGO archives with AES-2048 encryption.

### Use Case
Citizen scientists submit hydroponic data via TOAST, processed by a MAML workflow and archived in TORGO with GEA_CITIZEN for global access.

### Implementation
- Use `glas_astro_cli.py` to ingest and share data.
- Archive contributions in TORGO with `data_ingestor.py`.
- Validate with `bio_verifier.py` for integrity.

### Outcome
Expands global participation in space research through secure, interoperable systems.
