# MAML Security
## Protecting Workflows with TORGO

MAML workflows in the Glastonbury 2048 SDK are secured with TORGO’s 2048-bit AES encryption, ensuring data protection for astrobotany and quantum linguistics.

### Security Features
- **Encryption**: TORGO encrypts data payloads with AES-2048.
- **Permissions**: MAML’s YAML front matter defines access controls (read, write, execute).
- **Verification**: Digital signatures ensure workflow integrity.

### Implementation
- MAML workflows specify `permissions` and `verification` in YAML.
- TORGO archives outputs with `encryption=AES-2048`.
- Use `bio_verifier.py` for quantum-based integrity checks.

### Use Case
A MAML workflow analyzing sensitive genomic data is executed securely, with TORGO archiving results to prevent unauthorized access.

### Outcome
Ensures secure, trustworthy workflows for space research.
