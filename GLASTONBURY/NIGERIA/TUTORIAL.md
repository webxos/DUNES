# Connection Machine 2048-AES Tutorial: Emulating Philip Emeagwali’s Vision

## Introduction
This tutorial guides developers in building the **Connection Machine 2048-AES**, a quantum-ready, parallel computing system inspired by Philip Emeagwali’s work. It covers his methodologies for parallel processing, dataflow optimization, and distributed computing, with practical examples to implement a quadrilinear (4-node) system with 2048-bit AES encryption and quantum enhancements.

## Emeagwali’s Methodology
- **Massive Parallelism**: Emeagwali used 65,536 processors in the Connection Machine to solve complex problems (e.g., petroleum reservoir simulation) by dividing tasks into small, parallel chunks. Our system uses four quantum-parallel nodes (Quadrilinear Core) to emulate this approach.
- **Dataflow Optimization**: He optimized data movement to reduce latency, ensuring processors communicated efficiently. We implement this in `parallelizer.py` using tensor chunking and API synchronization.
- **Scalability**: His system scaled to handle massive datasets. We achieve this with Kubernetes and quantum circuit simulation in `quantum_simulator.py`.

## Tutorial: Building a Parallel Workflow
1. **Setup Environment**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/webxos/connection-machine-2048-aes.git
   cd connection-machine-2048-aes
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. **Implement Quadrilinear Engine**:
   - Study `quadrilinear_engine.py` to understand how tensors are split across four nodes.
   - Example: Run a matrix multiplication across nodes (see `example_matrix_multiply.maml.md`).
3. **Add 2048-bit AES Encryption**:
   - Use `aes_2048.py` to encrypt data before processing.
   - Ensure quantum-resistant security with large key sizes.
4. **Simulate Quantum Circuits**:
   - Implement a quantum AES algorithm in `quantum_simulator.py` using Qiskit.
   - Example: Simulate a 2-qubit circuit for key generation.
5. **Validate MAML Files**:
   - Use `maml_validator.py` to ensure workflows are secure and verifiable.
   - Example: Validate `example_matrix_multiply.maml.md` before execution.
6. **Deploy with Docker/Kubernetes**:
   - Use `docker-compose.yml` for local testing.
   - Scale with `k8s_deployment.yaml` for industrial deployment.

## Example: Parallel Matrix Multiplication
See `example_matrix_multiply.maml.md` for a MAML file that distributes a matrix multiplication across four nodes, encrypted with 2048-bit AES, and verified with Ortac.
