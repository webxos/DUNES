```ocaml
(* model_spec.mli *)
(* Purpose: OCaml Gospel specification for formal verification of CHIMERA 2048 workflows. *)
(* Customization: Add new types and functions to verify your custom logic. *)

type model
type label = Positive | Negative

val load : string -> model
(** [load path] loads a model from [path].
    @raises Invalid_argument if the file is malformed. *)

val predict : model -> float array -> label
(** [predict m features] runs prediction on [features].
    @requires Array.length features = 128
    @ensures result = Positive || result = Negative *)

(* To verify: Use Ortac with `ortac run model_spec.mli` *)
(* Customization: Extend with additional specifications for your models *)
