### üê™ CHIMERA 2048 API GATEWAY: Quantum-Distributed Control Hub with NVIDIA CUDA Cores

*Quantum-Enhanced Hybrid API Gateway and MCP Server with NVIDIA CUDA Cores
CHIMERA HUB is a quantum-distributed, self-regenerative hybrid API gateway and Model Context Protocol (MCP) server, supercharged with NVIDIA CUDA Cores to power the CHIMERA 2048 agentic system. It orchestrates four CHIMERA HEADS, each a self-contained model with 512-bit AES encryption, collectively forming a 2048-bit AES-equivalent quantum-simulated security layer. Leveraging advanced quantum logic via Qiskit, PyTorch for AI workflows. CHIMERA HUB integrates with Jupyter Notebooks, Prometheus, and Helm for scalable deployment. The hub's self-regenerative architecture enables each head to rebuild itself using data from the other three, ensuring continuous operation. The MAML (Markdown as Medium Language) protocol drives secure, executable workflows, making CHIMERA HUB a powerhouse for AI, quantum computing, and secure data processing.*
