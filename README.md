## 🐪  DUNES/.MAML System  
**Multi-Augmented Machine Learning Integration for Secure Network Exchange Systems**

DUNES (Distributed Unified Network Exchange System) is a next-generation cybersecurity framework powered by Multi-Augmented Machine Learning (MAML AKA MARKDOWN AS MEDIUM LANGUAGE). It introduces the `.MAML` protocol—a novel markup language for encoding multimodal security data—and a multi-agent architecture designed for quantum-resistant, adaptive threat detection.

## 🐪 Overview of MAML ##

**MAML (Markdown as Medium Language)** is a new syntax and protocol designed by Webxos to evolve Markdown into a structured, extensible, and machine-friendly documentation language. While Markdown democratized formatting, MAML transforms it into a **semantic medium**—bridging human readability with intelligent data transfer.

This guide introduces MAML to GitHub developers, outlining its syntax, use cases, and integration potential with modern API gateways, developer tools, and intelligent agents.

Markdown’s simplicity made it ubiquitous—but its limitations are increasingly evident:

- ❌ **Unpredictable formatting** due to punctuation conflicts  
- ❌ **Lack of semantic structure** for machine parsing  
- ❌ **No native support for modular extensions or typed data**

**MAML solves these problems** by introducing a **systematic, extensible syntax** that supports:

- ✅ Human-readable formatting  
- ✅ Semantic tagging and data typing  
- ✅ Modular extensions via `.maml.md` files  
- ✅ API-ready documentation for intelligent agents

## 📜 **MAML: Markdown as Medium Language**

### Overview
MAML redefines Markdown as a **living, executable container**—a "USB-C" for API gateways, enabling seamless data transfer, context management, and agent orchestration. Built for the AI and quantum era, MAML integrates with the Model Context Protocol (MCP), Quantum Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and advanced security layers.

## 📋 **Features**

### Core Innovations
- **Structured Schema:** YAML front matter and Markdown sections for metadata and content.
- **Dynamic Executability:** Run code blocks (Python, Qiskit, JavaScript) in sandboxed environments.
- **Agentic Context:** Embed context, permissions, and history for autonomous agents.
- **Quantum-Enhanced Security:** Post-quantum cryptography and noise patterns.
- **Interoperability:** Integrates with MCP, RAG, and Celery task queues.
