## Core Security Principles

### Zero-Trust MCP Architecture

Modern MCP systems must operate under the assumption that all components are potentially compromised. Our zero-trust approach implements:

- **Cryptographic Identity Verification**: Every MCP server interaction requires cryptographic proof of identity using hybrid quantum-classical signatures
- **Continuous Validation**: Real-time integrity checking of all data flows and model outputs
- **Microsegmentation**: Network-level isolation of MCP components with explicit allow-lists only

## Quantum-Resistant Architecture

### Hybrid Cryptographic Systems

Project Chimera implements a dual-signature protocol combining:

1. **Classical Post-Quantum Algorithms**: CRYSTALS-Dilithium for long-term security
2. **Quantum Key Distribution**: Real-time entropy generation using Qiskit-IBM-Runtime
3. **Advanced Hash Functions**: Custom 512-bit AES implementations with planetary-scale salt generation

```python
# Example: Chimera Quantum-Classical Signature
class ChimeraSignature:
    def __init__(self):
        self.quantum_component = QiskitQuantumSigner()
        self.pq_component = DilithiumSigner()
        
    def sign(self, data: bytes) -> ChimeraSignatureBundle:
        quantum_sig = self.quantum_component.sign(data)
        pq_sig = self.pq_component.sign(data)
        
        return ChimeraSignatureBundle(
            data_hash=sha3_512(data),
            quantum_signature=quantum_sig,
            post_quantum_signature=pq_sig,
            timestamp=quantum_timestamp(),
            entropy_proof=self.generate_entropy_proof()
        )
```

### Key Rotation Protocol

## AI-Specific Threat Mitigation

### Prompt Injection Defense System

Project Chimera introduces a multi-layered approach to prompt injection prevention:

#### 1. Semantic Analysis Gateway
```python
class ChimeraPromptGuard:
    def __init__(self):
        self.jailbreak_classifier = load_fast_classifier_model()
        self.semantic_similarity = SentenceTransformer('chimera-guard-v1')
        
    def analyze_prompt(self, prompt: str) -> SecurityAnalysis:
        # Multi-vector analysis
        jailbreak_score = self.jailbreak_classifier.predict(prompt)
        similarity_scores = self.check_known_attacks(prompt)
        structural_analysis = self.analyze_structure(prompt)
        
        return SecurityAnalysis(
            risk_level=self.calculate_risk(jailbreak_score, similarity_scores, structural_analysis),
            blocked_patterns=self.identify_threats(prompt),
            recommendation=self.generate_mitigation()
        )
```

#### 2. Training Data Poisoning Detection
- **Statistical anomaly detection** on all external data sources
- **Provenance tracking** for every piece of training data
- **Real-time validation** against known-good datasets

#### 3. Model Exfiltration Prevention
- **Network policy enforcement** preventing unauthorized outbound connections
- **Output sanitization** removing model-specific artifacts
- **Differential privacy** techniques for query responses

Before any MCP system enters production, it must pass the Chimera Gauntlet:

#### Phase 1: Infrastructure Hardening
- [ ] Kubernetes cluster configured with Pod Security Admissions (restricted)
- [ ] All container images signed with cosign and verified by Sigstore Policy Controller
- [ ] Network policies deny all traffic by default, explicit allowlists only
- [ ] etcd encryption at rest enabled with quantum-resistant algorithms

#### Phase 2: MCP Core Validation
- [ ] All MCP servers respond correctly to capability queries
- [ ] MAML.md processing pipeline validated with test vectors
- [ ] Quantum signature verification working for all components
- [ ] Vector database integrity confirmed with checksum validation

#### Phase 3: Security Posture Verification
- [ ] OWASP ZAP scan passed with zero critical findings
- [ ] eBPF runtime monitoring active and alerting properly
- [ ] All secrets rotated and stored in encrypted Vault
- [ ] Emergency backup procedures tested and validated

### Continuous Security Monitoring

```yaml
# Chimera Security Stack
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: chimera-security-config
data:
  ebpf_monitoring: "enabled"
  quantum_verification: "required"
  maml_validation: "strict"
  threat_detection: "advanced"

## Emergency Response Framework

### The Phoenix Protocol: Disaster Recovery

In the event of a security breach, Project Chimera implements the Phoenix Protocol:

#### Immediate Response (0-15 minutes)
1. **Automatic Isolation**: Kubernetes network policies sever all external connections
2. **Evidence Preservation**: Complete cluster state snapshot using Velero
3. **Alert Generation**: Multi-channel notifications to security team

#### Recovery Phase (15 minutes - 2 hours)
1. **Clean Environment Provisioning**: New cluster deployment in isolated account
2. **Cryptographic Regeneration**: All keys rotated using air-gapped quantum entropy
3. **Trusted Source Restoration**: Deployment from signed, verified artifacts only

#### The 4x Vial Agent System

Our autonomous recovery agents provide continuous operational resilience:

- **üß™ Vial of Training (Resilience)**: Automatically retrains models on clean data
- **üîç Vial of Validation (Integrity)**: Continuously audits system state against baselines  
- **‚öñÔ∏è Vial of Governance (Control)**: Manages multi-sig DAO operations during recovery
- **üí∞ Vial of Treasury (Continuity)**: Maintains offline emergency funds and wallet access
