## üåä **Introduction to the 2048-AES Floating Data Center Prototype**

Welcome to **PROJECT DUNES 2048-AES**, a revolutionary open-source initiative by WEBXOS ([webxos.netlify.app](https://webxos.netlify.app)) hosted on GitHub. This 10-page guide introduces a next-generation **floating data center prototype** powered by NVIDIA technology, Starlink connectivity, hybrid solar-saltwater power generation, and Tesla Optimus for autonomous maintenance, expansion, and protection. Designed to operate cost-free post-construction, this oceanic platform leverages the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** and **quantum-resistant logic** to deliver scalable, sustainable, and secure computational power. ‚ú®

This guide is optimized for the **PROJECT DUNES 2048-AES repository**, providing companies with a blueprint for investment costs, supply chains, and energy savings. The floating data center aligns with the **MAML (Markdown as Medium Language)** protocol, transforming Markdown into secure, executable data containers for workflows, datasets, and agent blueprints in harsh marine environments. üê™
