def analyze_city_data(data):
    tensor = torch.tensor([data.traffic_density, data.energy_usage])
    return {"avg_density": tensor[0].mean().item(), "avg_energy": tensor[1].mean().item()}
```

## Output_Schema

## üìã **Case Study 2: Autonomous Drone Logistics**

### Scenario
A logistics company deploys a fleet of drones for last-mile delivery in an urban environment. The system requires precise navigation, real-time environmental awareness, and secure data pipelines to ensure safe and efficient operations.

### Implementation
- **PROJECT DUNES Contribution**:  
  - **BELUGA**: Uses SOLIDAR‚Ñ¢ to fuse SONAR and LIDAR data, creating digital twins of flight paths updated in < 200ms.  
  - **OpenAI Swarm**: Coordinates drone tasks, optimizing routes based on digital twin data.  
  - **MAML**: Secures navigation logs with 512-bit AES encryption for high-security requirements.

  - Develops drone control systems integrated with BELUGA‚Äôs digital twins for real-time navigation.  
  - Implements automation pipelines to process Swarm-assigned tasks.  
  - Validates drone performance through R&D testing, ensuring collision avoidance and delivery accuracy.  

### Sample BELUGA Script
```python
from dunes.beluga import BELUGA
from openai_swarm import Swarm

beluga = BELUGA(config_path="beluga_config.yaml")
swarm = Swarm(config_path="ai_orchestration_config.yaml")

def coordinate_drone_delivery(drone_id: str, destination: dict):
    twin_data = beluga.retrieve_twin(f"drone_{drone_id}")
    route = swarm.optimize_route(drone_id, twin_data, destination)
    beluga.update_twin(f"drone_{drone_id}", route)
    return {"drone_id": drone_id, "route": route}
```

### Outcome
