# QFN Security FAQ

## Introduction

The **Quantum Fortran Network (QFN)** is designed with security as a core principle, using distributed AES-2048 encryption, prompt shielding, and operational guardrails to protect against fraudulent activity and ensure system integrity. This FAQ addresses common security concerns and provides best practices for maintaining a secure QFN deployment in production environments.

**Embedded Guidance**: Save this file in the `docs/` directory. Review it before deploying QFN to understand security features and maintenance procedures. Regularly update your `.env` file with new AES keys and monitor server logs for anomalies.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### 1. How does QFN implement prompt shielding?
**Prompt shielding** protects the QFN system from malicious or malformed inputs, particularly in the Python SDK and Fortran servers.

- **Mechanism**:
  - The SDK sanitizes inputs using a whitelist-based parser, rejecting invalid tensor formats or unexpected data types.
  - Fortran servers validate incoming requests against expected JSON/gRPC schemas, discarding malformed packets.
  - Example: In `qfn_sdk.py`, the `quadratic_transform` method converts inputs to `torch.tensor`, catching type errors early.
- **Implementation**:
  ```python
  def quadratic_transform(self, input_tensor):
      try:
          tensor = torch.tensor(input_tensor, dtype=torch.float32)
      except ValueError as e:
          raise ValueError("Invalid tensor format: {}".format(e))
  ```
- **Protection**: Prevents injection attacks, buffer overflows, and denial-of-service (DoS) attempts via malformed inputs.

**Embedded Guidance**: Ensure all SDK inputs are validated before processing. Update `qfn_sdk.py` to include additional checks for tensor dimensions or data ranges specific to your use case.

### 2. What guardrails are in place to ensure safe operation?
QFN incorporates guardrails to maintain system stability and security:

- **Rate Limiting**: Each Fortran server limits incoming requests to 100 per second, configurable via environment variables (`MAX_REQUESTS_PER_SECOND`).
- **Key Segmentation**: The AES-2048 key is split into four 512-bit segments, stored separately on each server, reducing the risk of key compromise.
- **Database Access Control**: The PostgreSQL database (`qfn_state`) uses role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict modifications to authorized users.
- **Logging**: All server interactions are logged to `/var/log/qfn/server_X.log`, with rotation to prevent disk exhaustion.

**Example Guardrail Configuration**:
```bash
# In .env
MAX_REQUESTS_PER_SECOND=100
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://qfn_user:secure_pass@localhost:5432/qfn_state
```

**Embedded Guidance**: Configure rate limits in your `.env` file based on expected traffic. Use a log aggregator (e.g., ELK Stack) to monitor server logs in real time.

### 3. How does QFN protect against fraudulent activity?
QFN’s distributed architecture and encryption prevent unauthorized access and fraud:

- **Distributed AES-2048 Encryption**:
  - The 2048-bit key is split across four servers using a secret-sharing scheme (e.g., Shamir’s Secret Sharing).
  - Compromising one server does not reveal the full key, ensuring data security.
- **Secure Communication**:
  - gRPC channels (planned for future implementation) use TLS 1.3 for end-to-end encryption.
  - Current `fsocket` communication requires IP whitelisting to restrict access.
- **Audit Trails**:
  - The PostgreSQL database logs all tensor transformations and encryption operations, timestamped for traceability.
  - Example query to check logs:
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM qfn_state WHERE timestamp > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 day';
    ```

**Embedded Guidance**: Rotate AES keys monthly by updating the `.env` file and restarting servers. Use a secrets manager (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault) to securely store and distribute keys.

### 4. How can I maintain and update QFN securely?
To keep QFN secure in production:

- **Regular Updates**:
  - Update Fortran dependencies via `fpm update`.
  - Update Python dependencies: `pip install --upgrade -r sdk/python/requirements.txt`.
- **Patch Management**:
  - Monitor GitHub for security advisories on dependencies (e.g., `grpcio`, `torch`).
  - Apply patches promptly to Fortran servers and the SDK.
- **Backup and Recovery**:
  - Back up the `qfn_state` database daily: `pg_dump qfn_state > backup.sql`.
  - Store backups in a secure, encrypted location.
- **Monitoring**:
  - Use tools like Prometheus and Grafana to monitor server performance and detect anomalies.
  - Example Prometheus metric for QFN:
    ```promql
    qfn_requests_total{server="server_1"}
    ```

**Embedded Guidance**: Schedule weekly maintenance to apply updates and review logs. Set up automated backups using `cron` or a similar scheduler.

### 5. What should I do if I suspect a security breach?
If you suspect fraudulent activity or a breach:

1. **Isolate the System**:
   - Stop all Fortran servers: `pkill -f qfn_server`.
   - Disable SDK access: Revoke database credentials in `DATABASE_URL`.
2. **Investigate Logs**:
   - Check server logs (`/var/log/qfn/`) and database logs for unauthorized access.
   - Query the `qfn_state` table for suspicious entries.
3. **Rotate Keys**:
   - Generate a new AES-2048 key and update `.env` with new `AES_MASTER_KEY` and `AES_KEY_SEGMENT_X` values.
   - Restart servers with new keys.
4. **Notify Stakeholders**:
   - Inform your team and review access policies.
   - If using xAI’s API, report incidents via https://x.ai/support.

**Embedded Guidance**: Maintain an incident response plan and test it quarterly. Ensure all team members know how to access logs and rotate keys securely.

### 6. How does QFN integrate with Project Dunes for security?
**Project Dunes** enhances QFN’s security by providing formal verification of workflows:

- **MAML Verification**:
  - Dunes validates MAML workflows (e.g., tensor transformations) to ensure they adhere to security policies.
  - Example: A MAML file is rejected if it attempts unauthorized database writes.
- **Runtime Guardrails**:
  - Dunes enforces runtime constraints, such as memory limits and execution timeouts, preventing resource exhaustion attacks.
- **Integration**:
  ```bash
  dunes verify workflows/tensor.maml.md
  dunes execute workflows/tensor.maml.md
  ```

**Embedded Guidance**: Install Project Dunes (`opam install dunes`) and validate all MAML files before execution. Store MAML files in a `workflows/` directory for organization.

## Best Practices for Production Deployment

1. **Network Security**:
   - Deploy QFN servers behind a firewall with only ports 50051–50054 exposed.
   - Use a VPN or SSH tunneling for remote access.
2. **Access Control**:
   - Restrict PostgreSQL access to localhost or a private network.
   - Use strong passwords and rotate them regularly.
3. **Monitoring and Alerts**:
   - Set up alerts for failed login attempts or high request rates.
   - Example: Configure Prometheus to alert on `qfn_requests_total > 1000`.
4. **Regular Audits**:
   - Conduct quarterly security audits of the QFN system.
   - Use tools like `nmap` to scan for open ports and vulnerabilities.

**Embedded Guidance**: Deploy QFN using Docker (`docker-compose.yml` from the SDK kit) to isolate services. Use a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx) to manage traffic and enforce TLS.
