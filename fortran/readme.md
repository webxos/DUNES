Quantum Fortran Network (QFN)
A distributed, high-performance computing network leveraging modern Fortran for quantum-inspired tensor operations, orchestrated by a Python SDK, and secured with distributed AES-2048 encryption.

Overview
The Quantum Fortran Network (QFN) is a novel system designed to perform high-performance, quantum-inspired computations using quadrilinear algebra. It consists of four specialized Fortran servers, each handling a 512-bit segment of a 2048-bit AES key, orchestrated by a Python-based Model SDK using PyTorch and SQLAlchemy Core. The system is designed for applications requiring high-performance numerical computing, such as scientific simulations, machine learning, and quantum algorithm prototyping.
Key Features

Quadrilinear Algebra: Extends traditional bilinear operations to 4D tensor computations, enabling quantum-inspired workflows.
Distributed Security: Uses a 2048-bit AES key split across four servers for robust encryption.
Python SDK: Provides a user-friendly interface for managing the network, integrating with PyTorch for ML tasks.
Scalable Architecture: Supports distributed computing with gRPC/Protocol Buffers for efficient communication.
Open Source: Licensed under MIT, encouraging community contributions.

Installation
Prerequisites

Fortran Compiler: gfortran or ifort (via fpm)
Python: Version 3.11+
Dependencies:
Fortran: fsocket, quadtensor_lib (custom, to be developed)
Python: grpcio, protobuf, torch, sqlalchemy, psycopg2


Database: PostgreSQL (for state management)
OS: Ubuntu 22.04+ or compatible Linux distribution

Steps

Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/qfn-system.git
cd qfn-system


Install Fortran Dependencies
fpm install


Install Python Dependencies
pip install -r sdk/python/requirements.txt


Set Up PostgreSQL
sudo apt install postgresql
createdb qfn_state


Configure EnvironmentCreate a .env file in sdk/python/:
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/qfn_state
AES_MASTER_KEY=your-2048-bit-key
SERVER_1_HOST=localhost:50051
SERVER_2_HOST=localhost:50052
SERVER_3_HOST=localhost:50053
SERVER_4_HOST=localhost:50054


Build and Run Servers
fpm run --target qfn_server_1
# Repeat for servers 2, 3, 4 in separate terminals


Run the SDK
cd sdk/python
python qfn_sdk.py



Usage Example
from qfn_sdk import QuantumFortranNetwork

# Initialize the SDK
qfn = QuantumFortranNetwork(
    server_hosts=["localhost:50051", "localhost:50052", "localhost:50053", "localhost:50054"],
    database_url="postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/qfn_state"
)

# Perform a quadrilinear transformation
input_tensor = [[[[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]], [[5.0, 6.0], [7.0, 8.0]]]]
result = qfn.quadratic_transform(input_tensor)

print(f"Resulting tensor: {result}")
