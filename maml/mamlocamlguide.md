# **MAML Language Guide: Part 2 - High-Assurance ML with OCaml, Ortac, and Project Dunes**

**For MCP Developers & Formal Methods Engineers**
**Version:** 2.0.0 (Dunes Extension)
**Publishing Entity:** Webxos Advanced Development Group & Project Dunes Initiative

## **Introduction**

This document extends the official MAML specification to incorporate **formal runtime verification** for machine learning workflows. It provides a practical integration guide for using the Ortac (OCaml RunTime Assertion Checking) tool within the Project Dunes MAML Gateway to create verifiably correct, robust, and secure ML pipelines.

The synergy of MAML's executable container format, OCaml's type-safe and verifiable code, and Ortac's automated specification checking enables a new class of **"Verified MAML"** files, crucial for high-stakes applications in finance, healthcare, and autonomous systems.

## **Core Concept: The Verified MAML Workflow**

A Verified MAML workflow ensures that the behavior of code blocks—especially those handling model inference, data transformation, and decision logic—adheres to a formal specification *before*, *during*, and *after* execution within the Project Dunes runtime.

**The Enhanced MAML Execution Flow in Project Dunes:**
1.  **Submission:** An Agent submits a `.maml.md` file containing OCaml code blocks with Gospel specifications.
2.  **Validation & Wrapping:** The Dunes Gateway:
    *   Parses the MAML metadata and permissions (using OCaml).
    *   Extracts OCaml code blocks and their associated Gospel specifications (`.mli` files).
    *   Invokes `ortac wrapper` to generate a new, instrumented OCaml module. This module wraps the original functions with runtime assertions derived from the specifications.
3.  **Ticket Issuance:** Only if the Ortac wrapping process succeeds does Dunes issue a **Signed Execution Ticket**. This ticket now implicitly guarantees that the code includes runtime checks.
4.  **Execution:** The instrumented code is executed in Dunes' secure OCaml sandbox.
5.  **Result & History:** Results are captured. Any assertion failure during execution is logged as a verifiable fault in the MAML's `History` section. Successful results are appended with a proof of verification.

## **MAML Schema Extension: Verification Metadata**

To support this workflow, the MAML Front Matter is extended with a new optional key:

### **Extended Front Matter Dictionary**

| Key | Value Type | Required | Description | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `verification` | Object | No | Declares the method and requirements for formal verification. | `verification:` <br> `  method: "ortac-runtime"` <br> `  spec_files: ["model_spec.mli"]` <br> `  level: "strict"` |

**Explanation of `verification` object:**
*   `method`: The verification toolchain to use. `"ortac-runtime"` is the primary method for Dunes integration.
*   `spec_files`: A list of files (e.g., `.mli` files containing Gospel specifications) that are required for verification. These files can be referenced via URLs or content hashes and are fetched by Dunes prior to execution.
*   `level`: The strictness of verification. `"strict"` fails the ticket issuance if Ortac finds any unsupported specifications or potential issues during wrapper generation. `"warn"` proceeds with best-effort checks.

## **Code Integration Guide: Ortac with MAML**

### **1. The OCaml Code Block with Gospel Specifications**

The power of this integration comes from pairing OCaml code in the `## Code_Blocks` section with a separate Gospel-specified interface (`.mli` file). This file can be included in the MAML's `## Context` or fetched from a URI declared in `verification.spec_files`.

**Example: A Verified ML Model Interface (`model_spec.mli`)**
This file would be referenced in the MAML's front matter.
```ocaml
(* File: model_spec.mli *)
(* Gospel specifications for a simple classifier module *)

type model
type label = Cat | Dog | Other

val load : string -> model
(** [load path] loads a model from the given [path].
    @raises Invalid_argument if the file at [path] is malformed. *)

val predict : model -> float array -> label
(** [predict m features] runs prediction on the feature vector [features].
    @requires Array.length features = 128
    @ensures the result is either Cat, Dog, or Other *)
```

### **2. The Corresponding MAML File**

The MAML file contains the implementation code and points to the specification.

```yaml
---
maml_version: "2.0.0"
id: "urn:uuid:987e6543-e21b-87d6-b654-426614174999"
type: "verifiable_inference"
origin: "agent://safety-critical-agent"
requires:
  libs: ["core"]
verification:
  method: "ortac-runtime"
  spec_files: ["model_spec.mli"]
  level: "strict"
permissions:
  execute: ["gateway://dunes-verifier"]
created_at: 2025-03-28T10:00:00Z

## Intent
Perform a verifiable inference using a pre-trained model. Runtime assertions generated by Ortac will guarantee the input and output adhere to the formal specification.

## Context
model_path: "/assets/model.bin"
input_features: [0.12, 0.45, ..., 0.88] # 128-element array

## Code_Blocks

```ocaml
(* File: model_impl.ml *)
(* This is the implementation that will be verified against model_spec.mli *)

type label = Cat | Dog | Other

let load path =
  (* ... implementation to deserialize a model ... *)
  if model_is_valid then model
  else raise (Invalid_argument "Malformed model file")

let predict model features =
  (* ... implementation logic ... *)
  (* The Ortac-generated wrapper will automatically check:
       - Array.length features = 128 (from @requires)
       - The return value is a valid 'label' (from return type)
  *)
  if condition then Cat
  else if other_condition then Dog
  else Other
```
```

## Input_Schema
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "features": {
      "type": "array",
      "items": { "type": "number" },
      "minItems": 128,
      "maxItems": 128
    }
  },
  "required": ["features"]
}

## History
- 2025-03-28T10:00:00Z: [CREATE] File instantiated by `safety-critical-agent`.

## **Project Dunes Integration: The Verification Gateway**

The Project Dunes runtime is extended with a **Verification Handler** that automates the Ortac workflow.

**How the Dunes Gateway Processes a Verifiable MAML (`verification.method: "ortac-runtime"`):**

1.  **Parse & Fetch:** The gateway parses the MAML front matter. If `verification` is present, it fetches the specified `spec_files`.
2.  **Invoke Ortac:** The gateway writes the OCaml code block and the specification file to a temporary directory. It then executes the Ortac command:
    ```bash
    ortac wrapper --input model_spec.mli --input-impl model_impl.ml -o instrumented_model.ml
    ```
3.  **Compile & Prepare:** The generated `instrumented_model.ml` file is compiled into a secure Dunes execution module. Any errors in this step (e.g., due to unsatisfiable specifications) cause ticket issuance to fail.
4.  **Execute:** The gateway runs the instrumented code. Every function call is checked against the Gospel assertions.
5.  **Handle Results:** If an assertion fails at runtime, execution halts, and a verifiable fault is recorded in the `History`. If successful, the results are packaged and returned.

---

## **Best Practices for Verified MAMLs**

1.  **Start with Specifications:** Define the Gospel `.mli` specification *before* writing the implementation code. This is analogous to test-driven development (TDD) for formal verification.
2.  **Use Simple, Executable Specifications:** Ortac translates Gospel into runtime checks. Avoid complex quantifiers and stick to executable preconditions (`requires`), postconditions (`ensures`), and exception specifications (`raises`).
3.  **Leverage the History for Auditing:** The `History` section becomes a verifiable audit log. Use entries like `[VERIFY]` and `[WRAP]` to prove that formal checks were performed before execution.
4.  **Combine with Traditional Testing:** Use the `ortac qcheck-stm` plugin to generate property-based tests during development. The MAML `## Code_Blocks` section can include these tests as a separate, runnable validation step before deployment.
5.  **Version Your Specifications:** The `spec_files` should be immutable and versioned. Reference them via a content-addressable URI (e.g., an IPFS hash) in the `verification` block to ensure reproducibility.

## **Conclusion: The Future of Verifiable Agentic Systems**

The integration of MAML, OCaml, Ortac, and Project Dunes creates a powerful framework for building **trustless, verifiable, and collaborative intelligent systems**. It allows developers to move beyond unit tests and code reviews to provide **mathematically verifiable guarantees** about critical code paths within agent workflows.

This transforms MAML from a simple executable document into a **carrier of verified intent**, where the code's behavior is provably bound to its specification, enabling a new level of safety and reliability in automated systems.
