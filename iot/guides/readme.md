## Page 1: Introduction to MAML and Markup for IoT with 2048-AES

### Overview
The **PROJECT DUNES 2048-AES** framework, developed by WebXOS, introduces a revolutionary approach to IoT device control and orchestration using the **MAML (Markdown as Medium Language)** protocol and **Markup (.mu)** syntax. This guide provides a comprehensive, 10-page manual for engineers to leverage MAML and Markup for designing, controlling, and integrating IoT devices with agentic systems like **CHIMERA 2048** and **GLASTONBURY 2048 SDKs**. These SDKs, available in the WebXOS GitHub repository, enable secure, quantum-resistant, and adaptive IoT workflows.

MAML transforms Markdown into a structured, executable, and secure data container, ideal for encoding IoT configurations, sensor data, and agent instructions. Markup (.mu) complements MAML by providing a reverse-syntax mechanism for error detection, digital receipts, and rollback operations. Together, they form a robust framework for IoT applications, integrating with the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for AI-orchestrated, edge-native operations.

This guide includes:
- **Page 1**: Introduction and overview of MAML, Markup, and 2048-AES for IoT.
- **Pages 2‚Äì9**: Eight detailed use cases, each focusing on a unique IoT application, with engineering-focused instructions for implementation using CHIMERA 2048 and GLASTONBURY 2048 SDKs.
- **Page 10**: Future enhancements and roadmap for IoT integration.

### Why MAML and Markup for IoT?
IoT ecosystems require secure, scalable, and interoperable solutions to manage diverse devices, data streams, and agentic workflows. MAML and Markup address these needs by:
- **Providing Structured Data**: MAML‚Äôs YAML front matter and semantic tagging enable precise device configurations and data schemas.
- **Ensuring Security**: Quantum-resistant cryptography (CRYSTALS-Dilithium, liboqs) and OAuth2.0 ensure secure data exchange.
- **Enabling Error Detection**: Markup‚Äôs reverse syntax (.mu) facilitates self-checking and rollback through mirrored receipts.
- **Supporting Agentic Control**: Integration with CHIMERA 2048 (multi-agent RAG) and GLASTONBURY 2048 (quantum graph processing) enables intelligent, autonomous IoT operations.
- **Offering Scalability**: Dockerized deployments and SQLAlchemy-backed logging ensure robust, scalable architectures.

### Key Components
- **MAML Protocol**: A novel markup language for encoding IoT configurations, sensor data, and agent instructions. Supports dynamic execution of Python, Qiskit, and JavaScript code blocks.
- **Markup (.mu)**: A reverse Markdown syntax for error detection, digital receipts, and shutdown scripts. Converts `.maml.md` to `.mu` for validation and auditability.
- **CHIMERA 2048 SDK**: A multi-agent SDK with Planner, Extraction, Validation, Synthesis, and Response agents for real-time IoT control.
- **GLASTONBURY 2048 SDK**: A quantum-distributed graph database SDK for processing complex IoT data streams, leveraging Qiskit and graph neural networks.
- **BELUGA 2048-AES**: A sensor fusion system integrating SONAR and LIDAR (SOLIDAR‚Ñ¢) for environmental IoT applications.

### Getting Started
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/webxos/project-dunes-2048-aes.git
   cd project-dunes-2048-aes
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   docker-compose up -d
   ```
3. **Configure MAML**:
   Create a `.maml.md` file with YAML front matter and code blocks for IoT configurations.
4. **Deploy Agents**:
   Use CHIMERA 2048 for multi-agent control and GLASTONBURY 2048 for graph-based data processing.
