## üìú Page 6: Factory Integration and Scalability  

This page outlines the factory integration and scalability strategies for PROJECT ARACHNID, designed to align with SpaceX‚Äôs Starbase manufacturing capabilities for producing 10 units by Q2 2026. Leveraging additive manufacturing, automated quality control, and the GLASTONBURY 2048 Suite SDK, ARACHNID‚Äôs production process ensures high reliability and cost efficiency for heavy-lift booster and Hypervelocity Autonomous Capsule (HVAC) operations. This section provides specifications, workflows, and engineering guidelines for integrating ARACHNID into production lines and scaling deployment.

### üè≠ 1. Factory Integration at SpaceX Starbase  

ARACHNID‚Äôs production is integrated with SpaceX‚Äôs Starbase facility in Boca Chica, Texas, utilizing existing Raptor engine assembly lines and advanced manufacturing technologies. The process focuses on modular assembly, additive manufacturing, and automated verification to meet the target of 10 units by Q2 2026.

#### üìè Manufacturing Specifications  
- **Production Target:** 10 ARACHNID units by Q2 2026 (2 units per quarter starting Q2 2025).  
- **Manufacturing Equipment:**  
  - **EOS M400 3D Printers:** For titanium-alloy (Ti-6Al-4V) leg components and Raptor-X nozzle parts.  
  - **KUKA Robotic Arms:** For automated assembly of hydraulic legs and sensor modules.  
  - **CNC Machining Centers:** For precision milling of crystal lattice reinforcements.  
- **Materials:**  
  - 70% titanium alloy (Ti-6Al-4V, 900 MPa yield strength).  
  - 20% carbon composite (T800 fiber, 2.7 GPa tensile strength).  
  - 10% zirconium-based crystal lattice (thermal resistance up to 6,500 K).  
- **Assembly Time:** 45 days per unit (30 days printing, 10 days assembly, 5 days testing).  
- **Quality Control:** CUDA-accelerated AutoCAD simulations and OCaml/Ortac formal verification.  
- **Facility Requirements:** 10,000 m¬≤ cleanroom, 50 MW power supply, liquid nitrogen storage for PAM cooling systems.  

#### üî¢ Production Model  
The production throughput is modeled using a lean manufacturing equation:  
\[
T = \frac{N \cdot C}{R}
\]  
Where:  
- \(T\): Total production time (45 days per unit).  
- \(N\): Number of units (10).  
- \(C\): Cycle time per unit (45 days).  
- \(R\): Resource parallelization factor (2 parallel assembly lines).  
- Resulting \(T \approx 225\) days for 10 units, meeting Q2 2026 deadline.  

### üõ†Ô∏è 2. Additive Manufacturing Process  

ARACHNID‚Äôs components are produced using EOS M400 3D printers, optimized for high-strength materials. The process includes:  
1. **Design Input:** AutoCAD models, validated by CUDA simulations for structural integrity.  
2. **Printing:** Layer-by-layer deposition of titanium alloy and carbon composite, with 50 ¬µm resolution.  
3. **Post-Processing:** Heat treatment (800¬∞C for 2 hours) to relieve residual stresses.  
4. **Assembly:** Robotic arms integrate printed components with Raptor-X engines and IoT sensors.  

#### üìè Printing Specifications  
- **Build Volume:** 400 √ó 400 √ó 400 mm per printer (8 printers per unit).  
- **Print Speed:** 50 mm¬≥/s for titanium, 100 mm¬≥/s for carbon composite.  
- **Material Usage:** 15 tons titanium, 4 tons carbon composite, 1 ton crystal lattice per unit.  
- **Defect Rate:** < 0.01%, verified by X-ray tomography.  

### üì° 3. Quality Control and Verification  

Quality control ensures 10,000-flight reliability, using:  
- **CUDA Simulations:** AutoCAD models simulate stress, thermal, and vibrational loads:  
\[
\sigma = \frac{F}{A}
\]  
Where:  
- \(\sigma\): Stress (MPa, target < 900 MPa for titanium).  
- \(F\): Force (500 kN per leg).  
- \(A\): Cross-sectional area (0.0025 m¬≤).  
- **Formal Verification:** OCaml/Ortac proofs validate system reliability, checking:  
  - Sensor data integrity (9,600 IoT streams).  
  - Hydraulic actuation (2 m stroke, 500 kN force).  
  - Raptor-X gimbal accuracy (¬±15¬∞).  
- **Database Logging:** SQLAlchemy-managed `arachnid.db` stores quality metrics:  
```sql
CREATE TABLE quality_metrics (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    component_id VARCHAR(50),
    stress FLOAT,
    thermal_load FLOAT,
    defect_status BOOLEAN,
    timestamp TIMESTAMP
);
```

### üìú 4. MAML Workflow for Production  

MAML scripts automate production workflows, integrating with the GLASTONBURY 2048 Suite SDK. Below is a sample workflow for component assembly:  

```yaml
# MAML Workflow: Assemble Hydraulic Leg
Context:
  task: "Assemble leg 1 with Raptor-X engine"
  environment: "Starbase cleanroom, 25¬∞C"
Input_Schema:
  components: { leg: {id: string, material: string}, engine: {id: string, thrust: float} }
Code_Blocks:
  ```python
  from manufacturing import AssemblyRobot
  robot = AssemblyRobot()
  leg_data = {"id": "LEG01", "material": "Ti-6Al-4V"}
  engine_data = {"id": "RAPTORX01", "thrust": 2000.0}
  assembly_status = robot.assemble_component(leg_data, engine_data)
  ```
Output_Schema:
  assembly_status: { success: bool, metrics: {stress: float, alignment: float} }
```

### üìä 5. Scalability Metrics  

| Metric                | Value           | Target          |
|-----------------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Production Rate       | 2 units/quarter | ‚â• 1 unit/quarter|
| Defect Rate           | < 0.01%         | ‚â§ 0.05%         |
| Assembly Time         | 45 days/unit    | ‚â§ 60 days/unit  |
| Material Efficiency   | 95%             | ‚â• 90%           |
| Uptime (Facility)     | 99.99%          | ‚â• 99.9%         |

### üõ†Ô∏è 6. Engineering Workflow  
Engineers can integrate ARACHNID into production using:  
1. **Setup:** Configure EOS M400 printers and KUKA robots via `arachnid-dunes-2048aes` repository (`git clone https://github.com/webxos/arachnid-dunes-2048aes`).  
2. **Simulation:** Run CUDA-accelerated AutoCAD simulations for component validation.  
3. **Scripting:** Write MAML workflows for assembly automation, stored in `.maml.md` files.  
4. **Monitoring:** Query `arachnid.db` for quality metrics using SQLAlchemy.  
5. **Verification:** Execute OCaml/Ortac proofs to ensure production reliability.  

### üìà 7. Visualization and Debugging  
Production metrics are visualized using Plotly:  
```python
from plotly.graph_objects import Bar
metrics = {"stress": [850, 860, 870], "defects": [0, 0, 1]}
fig = Bar(x=["LEG01", "LEG02", "LEG03"], y=metrics["stress"], name="Stress (MPa)")
fig.show()
```
