## üìú Page 5: Hypervelocity Autonomous Capsule (HVAC) Operations  

This page details the Hypervelocity Autonomous Capsule (HVAC) mode of PROJECT ARACHNID, a rapid-response configuration transforming the Rooster Booster into a standalone drone for emergency medical evacuations and critical missions on lunar or Martian surfaces. Designed for speed, precision, and autonomy, the HVAC mode leverages ARACHNID‚Äôs quantum control systems, BELUGA‚Äôs SOLIDAR‚Ñ¢ sensor fusion, and MAML-scripted workflows to execute round-trip missions within one hour using a single methalox tank. This section provides specifications, operational workflows, and engineering guidelines for HVAC deployment.

### üöë 1. HVAC Mode Overview  

The HVAC mode reconfigures ARACHNID from a heavy-lift booster into a 150-ton autonomous drone, capable of rapid deployment for medical evacuations, equipment delivery, or reconnaissance. It operates in a ‚ÄúREADY‚Äù state‚Äîsilent, smokeless, and cryogenically frozen‚Äîbooting in milliseconds upon receiving a distress signal. The system integrates with Starship as a mobile hospital airbase or operates independently for lunar/Martian missions.

#### üìè Specifications  
- **Dry Mass:** 150 tons (excluding propellant).  
- **Fueled Mass:** 1,200 tons (1,050 tons methalox).  
- **Thrust:** 16,000 kN (8 √ó Raptor-X engines, each 2,000 kN).  
- **Delta-V:** 9.8 km/s (sufficient for lunar round-trip).  
- **Propellant:** Methalox (CH‚ÇÑ + O‚ÇÇ), single tank for 1-hour missions.  
- **Payload Capacity:** 50 tons (medical equipment, personnel, or rescue gear).  
- **Deployment Mechanism:** Titanium-alloy ladders (extendable to 10 m) for surface access.  
- **Navigation:** BELUGA SOLIDAR‚Ñ¢ fusion (LIDAR + SONAR) for 1 cm precision in 200 mph winds.  
- **Response Time:** < 500 ms from signal to launch.  
- **Security:** CHIMERA 2048 AES encryption with CRYSTALS-Dilithium signatures.  

#### üî¢ Mission Dynamics  
The HVAC mode achieves a delta-v of 9.8 km/s, calculated via the Tsiolkovsky rocket equation:  
\[
\Delta v = v_e \ln\left(\frac{m_0}{m_f}\right)
\]  
Where:  
- \(v_e = 3.5 \, \text{km/s}\) (exhaust velocity for methalox, vacuum).  
- \(m_0 = 1,200 \, \text{tons}\) (initial fueled mass).  
- \(m_f = 150 \, \text{tons}\) (dry mass after burn).  
- Resulting \(\Delta v \approx 9.8 \, \text{km/s}\), enabling lunar round-trips or Martian surface missions.  

The mission profile includes ascent, transit, landing, and return, completed within 60 minutes, with 50% of propellant reserved for return.

### üõ†Ô∏è 2. Operational Workflow  

HVAC operations are orchestrated by the GLASTONBURY 2048 Suite SDK, using MAML scripts to translate mission commands into quantum-optimized control sequences. The workflow includes:  
1. **Signal Acquisition:** Distress signal received via 5G mesh network, authenticated by OAuth2.0.  
2. **System Boot:** Cryogenic systems thaw in 500 ms, initializing BELUGA neural net.  
3. **Trajectory Planning:** Qiskit‚Äôs variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) computes optimal path:  
\[
E = \min \sum_i \langle \psi_i | H | \psi_i \rangle
\]  
Where \(H\) encodes gravitational and environmental constraints.  
4. **Launch and Transit:** Raptor-X engines ignite, guided by SOLIDAR‚Ñ¢ fusion (1 cm resolution).  
5. **Surface Operations:** Titanium ladders deploy for personnel/equipment transfer.  
6. **Return:** Remaining propellant powers ascent and landing at origin.  

#### üìú Sample MAML Workflow for HVAC Mission  
```yaml
# MAML Workflow: Execute Lunar Rescue Mission
Context:
  task: "Deploy HVAC to lunar south pole for medical evacuation"
  environment: "Lunar vacuum, 1.62 m/s¬≤ gravity"
Input_Schema:
  distress_signal: { coordinates: {x: float, y: float, z: float}, priority: int }
  sensors: { lidar: {x: float, y: float, z: float}, sonar: {distance: float} }
Code_Blocks:
  ```python
  from qiskit import QuantumCircuit
  from beluga import SOLIDAREngine
  import torch
  engine = SOLIDAREngine()
  qc = QuantumCircuit(8)  # 8 qubits for 8 legs
  qc.h(range(8))  # Superposition for trajectory
  qc.measure_all()
  sensor_data = torch.tensor([[x1, y1, z1], ...], device='cuda:0')
  mission_plan = engine.execute_mission(sensor_data, qc, target=[x, y, z])
  ```
Output_Schema:
  mission_plan: { trajectory: {x: float, y: float, z: float}, ladder_deployment: bool }
```

### üì° 3. Sensor and Control Integration  

The HVAC mode leverages ARACHNID‚Äôs 9,600 IoT sensors and BELUGA‚Äôs SOLIDAR‚Ñ¢ engine for navigation:  
- **LIDAR:** Maps lunar/Martian terrain with 1 cm resolution.  
- **SONAR:** Compensates for dust-obscured environments (e.g., Martian storms).  
- **Control Loop:** BELUGA processes sensor data at 100 Hz, adjusting Raptor-X gimbal angles (¬±15¬∞) and leg strokes (0‚Äì2 m).  

The control system uses a PyTorch-based graph neural network (GNN) to fuse sensor data and quantum outputs, achieving 99.9% landing accuracy.

### üõ†Ô∏è 5. Engineering Workflow  
Engineers can deploy HVAC operations using:  
1. **Setup:** Initialize `arachnid-dunes-2048aes` repository (`git clone https://github.com/webxos/arachnid-dunes-2048aes`, `pip install -r requirements.txt`).  
2. **Simulation:** Test missions in CUDA-accelerated environments simulating lunar/Martian conditions.  
3. **Scripting:** Write MAML workflows for mission planning, stored in `.maml.md` files.  
4. **Monitoring:** Query `arachnid.db` for mission logs using SQLAlchemy.  
5. **Verification:** Run OCaml/Ortac proofs to ensure 10,000-flight reliability.  

### üìà 6. Visualization and Debugging  
Mission trajectories and sensor data are visualized using Plotly:  
```python
from plotly.graph_objects import Scatter3d
import torch
trajectory = torch.tensor([[x1, y1, z1], ...], device='cuda:0')
fig = Scatter3d(x=trajectory[:,0], y=trajectory[:,1], z=trajectory[:,2], mode='lines')
fig.show()
```
