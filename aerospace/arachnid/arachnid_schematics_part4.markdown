# PROJECT ARACHNID Part 4: Factory Integration and Mass Production

## Factory Integration
- **Location**: SpaceX Starbase, Boca Chica, Texas.
- **Infrastructure**: Utilize existing Raptor engine assembly lines, augmented with ARACHNID-specific titanium plating and hydraulic assembly stations.
- **Production Rate**: 10 units by Q2 2026, with 2 units per month starting Q1 2026.

## Manufacturing Process
1. **Titanium Plating**: 3D printing with titanium crystal lattice, using EOS M400 printers.
2. **Hydraulic Legs**: Assembly with electro-hydraulic actuators, integrated with PAM heat shields.
3. **IoT Integration**: Embed 1,200 micro IoT sensors per engine using automated pick-and-place systems.
4. **Engine Assembly**: ARACHNID Raptor-X engines built alongside standard Raptors, with CHIMERA 2048 AES chips installed.

## Quality Control
- **Simulations**: CUDA-accelerated AutoCAD simulations for 10,000-flight durability.
- **Testing**: Static fire tests at McGregor facility, with 33-engine Starship tests adapted for 41 engines (33 standard + 8 ARACHNID).
- **Verification**: Ortac-based formal verification for control systems.

## Deployment Strategy
- **Integration**: Attach ARACHNID to Starship hull via standardized docking ports.
- **Timeline**:
  - Q1 2026: Prototype testing.
  - Q2 2026: Mass production.
  - Q3 2026: Orbital test flights.
  - Q4 2026: Mars mission with triple-stacked Starship (300-ton payload).
