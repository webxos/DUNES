# MACROSLOW: Guide to Using OpenAI’s API with Model Context Protocol (MCP)

## PAGE 3: Setting Up the OpenAI API with MACROSLOW

This page provides a step-by-step guide to configuring **OpenAI’s API** (version October 2025, powered by GPT-4o) for integration with the **MACROSLOW ecosystem**, enabling secure, scalable, and quantum-enhanced applications within the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**. The setup process involves initializing the OpenAI client, deploying a Dockerized MCP server, and integrating with MACROSLOW’s SDKs (**DUNES Minimal SDK**, **CHIMERA Overclocking SDK**, and **GLASTONBURY Medical Use SDK**). This configuration leverages **MAML (Markdown as Medium Language)** workflows, 2048-bit AES-equivalent encryption, and quantum-resistant **CRYSTALS-Dilithium** signatures to ensure robust security and performance. The instructions are tailored for developers familiar with Python, Docker, and quantum computing concepts, ensuring seamless deployment as of October 17, 2025.

### Prerequisites

Before setting up the OpenAI API with MACROSLOW, ensure the following requirements are met:
- **Python 3.10+**: Required for running MACROSLOW’s Python-based components.
- **Docker**: Used to deploy the MCP server and manage dependencies.
- **NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit 12.3+**: Necessary for CHIMERA and GLASTONBURY SDKs to leverage GPU acceleration (e.g., NVIDIA H100 for 78x training speedup).
- **OpenAI API Key**: Obtain from [platform.openai.com/account/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).
- **Dependencies**:
  ```bash
  openai==1.45.0
  torch==2.4.0
  sqlalchemy==2.0.31
  fastapi==0.111.0
  qiskit==0.46.0
  uvicorn==0.30.1
  pyyaml==6.0.1
  pynvml==11.5.0
  ```

### Installation

Follow these steps to set up the MACROSLOW environment and integrate OpenAI’s API:

1. **Clone the MACROSLOW Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/webxos/macroslow.git
   cd macroslow
   ```

2. **Install Python Dependencies**:
   Install the required packages, including the OpenAI client library:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   pip install openai==1.45.0
   ```

3. **Set Environment Variables**:
   Create a `.env` file to store sensitive configuration details:
   ```bash
   echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key" >> .env
   echo "MARKUP_DB_URI=sqlite:///mcp_logs.db" >> .env
   echo "MARKUP_API_HOST=0.0.0.0" >> .env
   echo "MARKUP_API_PORT=8000" >> .env
   ```
   Replace `your_api_key` with the key obtained from OpenAI’s platform.

4. **Build and Run the Docker Container**:
   Build the Docker image for the MCP server, optimized for GPU acceleration:
   ```bash
   docker build -f chimera/chimera_hybrid_dockerfile -t mcp-openai .
   docker run --gpus all -p 8000:8000 --env-file .env mcp-openai
   ```

### Configuring the OpenAI Client

Initialize the OpenAI client within a Python script to interact with the API:
```python
import os
import openai

client = openai.OpenAI(api_key=os.environ.get("OPENAI_API_KEY"))
```

This script sets up the OpenAI client, ready to process MAML workflows and execute API calls for tasks like tool calling, NLP, and multi-modal data analysis.

### MCP Server Setup

Deploy the FastAPI-based MCP server to orchestrate workflows and handle OpenAI API requests:
```bash
uvicorn mcp_server:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

The server exposes an endpoint at `http://localhost:8000/execute` for submitting MAML files, which are validated using OCaml’s Ortac runtime and processed by GPT-4o for tasks like real-time data retrieval or quantum-enhanced computations.

### Testing the Setup

To verify the integration, create a simple MAML file (`test.maml.md`) to test OpenAI’s API:
```markdown
---
maml_version: "2.0.0"
id: "urn:uuid:1a2b3c4d-5e6f-7a8b-9c0d-1e2f3a4b5c6d"
type: "workflow"
origin: "agent://openai-test-agent"
requires:
  libs: ["openai==1.45.0"]
permissions:
  execute: ["gateway://local"]
---
## Intent
Test OpenAI API integration with a simple query.

## Code_Blocks
```python
import openai
client = openai.OpenAI()
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o-2025-10-15",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello, world!"}],
    max_tokens=4096
)
print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```
```

Submit the MAML file to the MCP server:
```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: text/markdown" -H "x-api-key: $OPENAI_API_KEY" --data-binary @test.maml.md http://localhost:8000/execute
```

The server will process the MAML file, execute the OpenAI API call, and return a JSON response with GPT-4o’s output, typically a greeting like “Hello, world!” or a confirmation of successful execution.

### Integration with MACROSLOW SDKs

The OpenAI API integrates with MACROSLOW’s three SDKs, each tailored for specific use cases:
- **DUNES Minimal SDK**: Lightweight framework for text-based workflows, ideal for OpenAI’s tool-calling capabilities, achieving sub-90ms latency on Jetson Orin platforms.
- **CHIMERA Overclocking SDK**: Quantum-enhanced API gateway for high-performance NLP in cybersecurity and data science, leveraging GPT-4o’s 128k token context window for complex MAML files.
- **GLASTONBURY Medical SDK**: Specialized for medical IoT and diagnostics, using GPT-4o for patient interaction and multi-modal data analysis (e.g., ECG waveforms, Apple Watch biometrics).

### Key Features of the Setup
- **Scalability**: The Dockerized MCP server, combined with Kubernetes/Helm, supports distributed deployments, handling up to 10,000 concurrent requests with 87% CUDA efficiency.
- **Security**: MAML files are validated with Ortac runtime and secured with 2048-bit AES-equivalent encryption and CRYSTALS-Dilithium signatures, ensuring quantum resistance.
- **Performance**: GPT-4o’s 4.5x faster inference speed (232ms for cybersecurity tasks) enhances real-time processing, validated in CHIMERA SDK tests.

### Troubleshooting
- **API Key Errors**: Ensure the `OPENAI_API_KEY` is valid and correctly set in the `.env` file. A 401 error indicates an invalid key.
- **Rate Limits**: OpenAI’s API enforces limits (e.g., 10,000 tokens/min for Tier 1 accounts). Check [platform.openai.com/account/limits](https://platform.openai.com/account/limits) for details. A 429 error indicates rate limit exhaustion.
- **Docker Issues**: Verify GPU support with `nvidia-smi` and ensure the CUDA Toolkit is installed.

This setup enables developers to harness OpenAI’s GPT-4o within MACROSLOW’s qubit-based ecosystem, ready for tool calling, agentic workflows, and quantum-enhanced applications across DUNES, CHIMERA, and GLASTONBURY SDKs.
