  - **Docker** for containerized deployment of MCP servers.
  - **NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit 12.2+** for GPU-accelerated tasks, particularly for CHIMERA and GLASTONBURY SDKs, requiring NVIDIA GPUs like H100 or Jetson Orin (minimum 275 TOPS for edge AI).
- **Software Dependencies**:
  - Core libraries: `anthropic==0.12.0`, `torch==2.3.1`, `sqlalchemy==2.0.20`, `fastapi==0.103.0`, `qiskit==0.45.0`, `uvicorn==0.23.2`, `pyyaml==6.0.1`, `pynvml==11.5.0`.
  - Additional tools: `requests==2.31.0`, `pydantic==2.5.0`, `prometheus_client==0.17.0` for monitoring.
- **Anthropic API Key**: Obtain a key from [console.anthropic.com/account/keys](https://console.anthropic.com/account/keys). Use Anthropic’s [workspaces](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/workspaces) to segment keys by use case and manage rate limits.
- **Network Access**: Ensure access to [api.anthropic.com](https://api.anthropic.com) and a stable internet connection for API calls.
- **MACROSLOW Repository**: Clone the Project Dunes repository from [github.com/webxos/project-dunes-2048-aes](https://github.com/webxos/project-dunes-2048-aes) to access SDKs and MAML templates.

These prerequisites ensure compatibility with MACROSLOW’s quantum-enhanced infrastructure and Claude’s API, which supports JSON-based requests with a 32 MB limit for standard endpoints, 256 MB for Batch API, and 500 MB for Files API as of October 2025.

### Step-by-Step Installation Process

Follow these steps to set up the Claude API within the MACROSLOW ecosystem, ensuring a fully operational MCP server environment.

#### 1. Clone the MACROSLOW Repository
The MACROSLOW ecosystem is hosted on GitHub, providing access to DUNES, CHIMERA, and GLASTONBURY SDKs, along with sample MAML files and Docker configurations. Clone the repository to your local system:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/webxos/project-dunes-2048-aes.git
cd project-dunes-2048-aes
```
This command downloads the latest repository, including directories for `dunes_minimal`, `chimera`, `glastonbury`, and `maml_templates`.

#### 2. Install Python Dependencies
Install the required Python libraries specified in the repository’s `requirements.txt` file, along with the Anthropic SDK for Claude API access:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install anthropic==0.12.0
```
The `requirements.txt` includes dependencies like `torch`, `sqlalchemy`, `fastapi`, and `qiskit`, ensuring compatibility with MACROSLOW’s quantum and AI workflows. Verify the installation by running:
```bash
python -c "import anthropic, torch, qiskit, fastapi; print('Dependencies installed successfully')"
```

#### 3. Configure Environment Variables
Set up environment variables to securely manage API keys, database connections, and server settings. Create a `.env` file in the repository root:
```bash
touch .env
```
Add the following variables to `.env`:
```bash
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
MARKUP_DB_URI=sqlite:///mcp_logs.db
MARKUP_API_HOST=0.0.0.0
MARKUP_API_PORT=8000
MARKUP_QUANTUM_ENABLED=true
MARKUP_QUANTUM_API_URL=http://localhost:8000/quantum
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0
```
- Replace `your_api_key_here` with your Anthropic API key from the console.
- `MARKUP_DB_URI` specifies the SQLAlchemy database (SQLite for simplicity; use PostgreSQL for production).
- `MARKUP_QUANTUM_ENABLED` activates quantum circuit integration for CHIMERA and GLASTONBURY.
- `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` selects the GPU for NVIDIA CUDA tasks.
Load the environment variables:
```bash
source .env
```

#### 4. Build the Docker Image
MACROSLOW uses Docker for scalable, reproducible deployments. Build a Docker image for the MCP server, incorporating Claude and quantum dependencies:
```bash
docker build -f chimera/chimera_hybrid_dockerfile -t mcp-claude:1.0.0 .
```
The `chimera_hybrid_dockerfile` includes multi-stage builds for Python, Qiskit, and NVIDIA CUDA, ensuring GPU acceleration and quantum circuit support. Verify the build:
```bash
docker images | grep mcp-claude
```

#### 5. Run the MCP Server
Launch the Dockerized MCP server with GPU support and environment variables:
```bash
docker run --gpus all -p 8000:8000 --env-file .env -d mcp-claude:1.0.0
```
This command maps port 8000 for FastAPI access and enables CUDA acceleration. Alternatively, run the server directly with Uvicorn for development:
```bash
uvicorn mcp_server:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```
Verify the server is running by accessing the FastAPI docs:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/docs
```

#### 6. Configure Claude API Client
Initialize the Anthropic client within a Python script to interact with the Claude API. Create a file named `claude_init.py`:
```python
import os
import anthropic

# Initialize Claude client
client = anthropic.Anthropic(api_key=os.environ.get("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"))

# Test API connectivity
try:
    response = client.messages.create(
        model="claude-3-5-sonnet-20251015",
        max_tokens=1024,
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Test connection to Claude API"}]
    )
    print("Claude API connected:", response.content)
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error connecting to Claude API: {e}")
```
Run the script to confirm API connectivity:
```bash
python claude_init.py
```

### Integrating Claude with MCP Workflows

To integrate Claude with MCP, configure the MCP server to process MAML files that include Claude API calls. A sample MAML file for a medical diagnostic workflow might look like this:
```markdown
---
maml_version: "2.0.0"
id: "urn:uuid:4a5b6c7d-8e9f-0a1b-2c3d-4e5f6g7h8i9j"
type: "workflow"
origin: "agent://claude-medical-agent"
requires:
  libs: ["anthropic==0.12.0", "sqlalchemy==2.0.20"]
permissions:
  read: ["patient_records://*"]
  write: ["diagnosis_db://claude-outputs"]
  execute: ["gateway://glastonbury-mcp"]
verification:
  method: "ortac-runtime"
  spec_files: ["medical_workflow_spec.mli"]
created_at: 2025-10-17T14:30:00Z
---
## Intent
Analyze patient symptoms using Claude for preliminary diagnosis.

## Context
Patient: 45-year-old male, symptoms: fever, cough, fatigue.

## Code_Blocks
```python
import anthropic
from sqlalchemy import create_engine

client = anthropic.Anthropic()
engine = create_engine(os.environ.get("MARKUP_DB_URI"))
message = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-3-5-sonnet-20251015",
    max_tokens=1024,
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Diagnose symptoms: fever, cough, fatigue"}]
)
with engine.connect() as conn:
    conn.execute("INSERT INTO diagnoses (result) VALUES (?)", (message.content,))
```
```
Save this as `medical_diagnosis.maml.md` and submit it to the MCP server:
```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: text/markdown" -H "x-api-key: $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY" --data-binary @medical_diagnosis.maml.md http://localhost:8000/execute
```
The MCP server routes the MAML file to Claude, which processes the symptoms and stores the diagnosis in the database, validated by Ortac for correctness.

### Security and Authentication

Claude API requests require an `x-api-key` header, automatically handled by the Anthropic SDK. Ensure the `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable is set. MCP enhances security with:
- **2048-bit AES Encryption**: Combines four 512-bit AES keys for quantum-resistant data protection.
- **CRYSTALS-Dilithium Signatures**: Validates MAML file integrity, protecting against quantum attacks.
- **OAuth2.0 with JWT**: Syncs authentication via AWS Cognito for secure API access.
Set the `content-type: application/json` header for all requests, as Claude exclusively uses JSON. The MCP server’s FastAPI gateway enforces these headers, ensuring compliance.

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

- **API Key Errors**: Verify the `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is correct and active in [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com). A 401 error indicates an invalid key.
- **Request Size Exceeded**: Standard endpoints are limited to 32 MB. Split large requests or use the Batch API (256 MB) for bulk processing.
- **Database Connection Issues**: Ensure `MARKUP_DB_URI` is valid (e.g., `sqlite:///mcp_logs.db`). For PostgreSQL, confirm credentials and network access.
- **GPU Not Detected**: Verify CUDA Toolkit installation and `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` setting. Run `nvidia-smi` to check GPU availability.
- **Server Not Responding**: Check if Uvicorn or Docker is running (`docker ps`) and ports are open (`netstat -tuln | grep 8000`).
For persistent issues, consult logs in `mcp_logs.db` or contact the WebXOS community at [x.com/macroslow](https://x.com/macroslow).

### Optimizing for MACROSLOW SDKs

- **DUNES Minimal SDK**: Use lightweight MAML files for Claude’s text-based tool calling, minimizing resource usage on edge devices like Jetson Orin.
- **CHIMERA Overclocking SDK**: Leverage Claude’s multi-modal processing with CHIMERA’s four-headed architecture for high-performance tasks, utilizing H100 GPUs for 76x training speedup.
- **GLASTONBURY Medical SDK**: Integrate Claude with medical IoT streams (e.g., Apple Watch) and SQLAlchemy for real-time diagnostics, achieving 99% accuracy.

This setup ensures Claude is fully integrated with MACROSLOW, ready to execute secure, scalable, and quantum-enhanced MCP workflows as of October 2025.
