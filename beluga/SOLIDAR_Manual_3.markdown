# SOLIDAR™ Manual: Advanced AR Video Processing Framework

## Overview
SOLIDAR™ provides a framework for advanced augmented reality (AR) video processing, enabling real-time 3D modeling and visualization.

## AR Processing Workflow
1. **Sensor Data Collection**:
   - SONAR and LIDAR data are collected simultaneously.
   - Quantum-enhanced denoising ensures high signal quality.

2. **Feature Extraction**:
   - Neural networks process LIDAR data for spatial features.
   - SONAR data is processed for acoustic spatial mapping.

3. **Graph Fusion**:
   - A CUDA-accelerated graph neural network fuses data into a 3D model.
   - Quadtilinear mathematics enhances model precision.

4. **AR Visualization**:
   - The 3D model is streamed to OBS via WebSocket.
   - AR goggles (e.g., Oculus Rift) display the model in real-time.
   - Video bitrate: 6000 (video), 160 (audio).

5. **Power Management**:
   - 256-bit AES mode for low-power IoT edge devices.
   - 2048-bit mode for high-security applications.

## Use Cases
- **Aerospace**: Real-time navigation for spacecraft.
- **Deep Sea**: 3D mapping for submarines.
- **Archaeology**: Precise modeling for subterranean exploration.
- **Security**: Real-time 3D imaging for surveillance systems.
