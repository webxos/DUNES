# SOLIDAR™ Manual: Real-Time 3D Modeling

## Overview
SOLIDAR™ (SONAR-LIDAR Adaptive Fusion) is BELUGA’s proprietary sensor fusion technology, designed to create real-time, high-fidelity 3D models from SONAR and LIDAR data streams, optimized for extreme environments.

## Process
1. **SONAR Data Capture**:
   - High-frequency acoustic pulses are emitted and received by BELUGA’s sonar module.
   - Quantum denoising via Qiskit removes noise and enhances signal clarity.
   - Data is converted into a graph-based spatial representation.

2. **LIDAR Data Capture**:
   - Laser pulses measure distances to create a point cloud.
   - Neural network processing extracts high-resolution spatial features.
   - Data is converted into a graph-based representation.

3. **Data Fusion**:
   - The graph neural network fuses SONAR and LIDAR graphs into a unified 3D model.
   - CUDA-accelerated processing ensures <150ms latency.
   - Output is delivered as RAW layered video data for AR visualization.

4. **OBS Integration**:
   - The fused 3D model is streamed to OBS (Open Broadcaster Software) via WebSocket.
   - Real-time visualization is achieved in AR goggles or headsets.

## Output
- **RAW Layered Video Data**: Multi-layered, high-resolution video feed for AR applications.
- **Security**: 2048-bit AES-equivalent encryption with adaptive modes (256-bit, 512-bit, 2048-bit).
- **Applications**: Drones, submarines, IoT cave mining drones, spacecraft, AR goggles.
