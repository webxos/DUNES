Inspired by the beluga whale's masterful echolocation in Arctic voids, **BELUGA** (Bilateral Environmental Linguistic Ultra Graph Agent) emerges as the quantum leviathan of drone intelligence. This 10-page guide fuses BELUGA's **SOLIDAR‚Ñ¢** sensor fusion (SONAR-LIDAR Adaptive Fusion) with **SLAM** (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) and **YOLOv8** object detection, empowering diverse drone platforms‚Äîfrom nimble Tiny Whoop micro-drones to long-range FPV (First-Person View) quads and coordinated swarms. Whether scouting subterranean caves, mapping urban potholes, or orchestrating planetary surveys, BELUGA transforms raw sensor chaos into precise, real-time 3D digital twins, secured by 2048-bit AES-equivalent encryption and accelerated via Qiskit quantum circuits.

**Why BELUGA for Drones?**  
In 2025's aerial renaissance, drones demand resilience in GPS-denied environments (e.g., indoors, urban canyons, or deep space analogs). BELUGA's quantum graph database and MAML/MU protocol enable adaptive, verifiable workflows, integrating seamlessly with WebXOS ecosystems: [drone.webxos.netlify.app](https://drone.webxos.netlify.app) for flight orchestration and [swarm.webxos.netlify.app](https://swarm.webxos.netlify.app) for multi-agent coordination. Building on YOLOv8's 80+ FPS edge detection (e.g., pothole spotting at 0.7-0.9 confidence) and SLAM's cm-level mapping, BELUGA achieves sub-150ms latency for swarm ops, slashing operational costs by 40% in industries like agriculture, search-and-rescue, and mining.

**Key Integrations Overview:**
- **SLAM + SOLIDAR‚Ñ¢**: Quantum-enhanced mapping fuses LIDAR/SONAR with visual odometry for robust localization.
- **YOLOv8 Fusion**: Real-time object detection (e.g., obstacles, assets) layered into 3D graphs via PyTorch/CUDA.
- **Drone Variants**: Tiny Whoop (indoor agility), FPV (high-speed scouting), Long-Range (BVLOS endurance), and more.
- **Swarm Capabilities**: Decentralized coordination via WebXOS Swarm API, with CHIMERA 2048 for quad-core processing.
- **Security & Protocol**: MAML/MU for executable workflows; OBS streaming for AR visualization.

**Prerequisites:**
- Python 3.10+ with CUDA 12.0; Qiskit 0.45+ for quantum sim.
- Hardware: PX4/ArduPilot flight controllers; edge GPUs (Jetson Nano/Orin).
- Accounts: WebXOS GitHub for templates; D-Wave Leap for quantum access.
- Ethical Note: Comply with FAA/EASA regs; prioritize privacy in swarm deployments.
