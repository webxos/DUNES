# SOLIDAR™ Manual: Integration with CHIMERA 2048

## Overview
This manual describes how SOLIDAR™ integrates with CHIMERA 2048’s four hybrid computational cores for enhanced processing and security.

## Integration Process
1. **Data Ingestion**:
   - SOLIDAR™ captures SONAR and LIDAR data streams.
   - Data is encrypted using CHIMERA’s 2048-bit AES-equivalent encryption.

2. **Quantum Processing**:
   - CHIMERA’s HEAD_1 and HEAD_2 execute quantum circuits via Qiskit for denoising and feature enhancement.
   - Latency is maintained below 150ms.

3. **AI Processing**:
   - CHIMERA’s HEAD_3 and HEAD_4 use PyTorch for neural network-based feature extraction and model training.
   - CUDA cores achieve 76x training speedup and 4.2x inference speed.

4. **Fusion and Output**:
   - SOLIDAR™ fuses data into a unified graph using graph neural networks.
   - Output is streamed to OBS for real-time AR visualization.
   - 256-bit low-power mode is used for edge IoT devices.

## Security
- Data is secured using CHIMERA’s quadra-segment regeneration and quantum-resistant cryptography.
- Adaptive power modes ensure efficiency in resource-constrained environments.
