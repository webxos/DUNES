# Quantum MCP for Dummies: Part 3 - Building Quadralinear API Functions

Hey, quantum trailblazer! In Part 3 of *Quantum MCP for Dummies*, we’re cranking up your **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** router by adding quadralinear API functions. These will let your computer handle complex, multidimensional tasks—like optimizing a supply chain with cost, time, demand, and weather—all at once. With **PROJECT DUNES 2048-AES** and its **MAML protocol**, we’ll transform your bilinear machine into a quadralinear powerhouse. Let’s roll!

## What Are Quadralinear API Functions?

Your computer’s MCP router is already talking to quantum servers. Now, we’ll add **API functions** that process four or more variables simultaneously, unlike bilinear APIs that handle just two (e.g., input vs. output). These functions use quantum parallelism—**superposition** and **entanglement**—to crunch data faster, with **PROJECT DUNES** securing everything via 2048-bit AES and CRYSTALS-Dilithium.

## Building Your API

Let’s create an API function to optimize a delivery route. You’ll need **FastAPI**, **Qiskit**, and your IBM Quantum API token (from Part 2). Here’s a sample:
```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, IBMQ
app = FastAPI()
IBMQ.load_account()

@app.get("/optimize-route")
def optimize_route(cost: float, time: float, demand: float, weather: float):
    qc = QuantumCircuit(4)  # Four qubits for cost, time, demand, weather
    qc.h([0, 1, 2, 3])  # Superposition on all
    qc.cx(0, 1)  # Entangle cost and time
    qc.cx(1, 2)  # Entangle time and demand
    qc.cx(2, 3)  # Entangle demand and weather
    qc.measure_all()
    provider = IBMQ.get_provider()
    backend = provider.get_backend('ibmq_qasm_simulator')
    result = backend.run(qc).result()
    counts = result.get_counts()
    return {"optimal_route": max(counts, key=counts.get)}

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import uvicorn
    uvicorn.run(app, host="0.0.0.0", port=8000)
```

Run this and hit `http://localhost:8000/optimize-route?cost=100&time=2&demand=50&weather=0.8`. Your API returns the best route, considering all variables at once!

## Bilinear to Quadralinear

Bilinear APIs process pairs (e.g., cost vs. time). Quadralinear APIs, using **tensor products**, handle multiple variables as a single, entangled state. The **Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE)** optimizes these, finding the best solution fast. **PROJECT DUNES**’ MAML files package the data securely, making your API a quantum fortress.

## Why It Rocks

Your API can optimize logistics, finance, or even gaming (like **GalaxyCraft** from **PROJECT DUNES**). It’s fast, secure, and handles complexity like a pro, turning your computer into a quantum superhero.

**Next Up:** Part 4 covers securing your MCP router. Keep rocking the quantum vibes!
