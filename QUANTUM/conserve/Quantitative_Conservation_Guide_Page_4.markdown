## MCP Monitoring and Auditing

Continuous monitoring and auditing are critical for maintaining quantitative conservation in the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** within **PROJECT DUNES 2048-AES**. These processes ensure that the system adheres to predefined metrics for context integrity, such as token efficiency, context loss rate, tool call success rate, and API call volume. By systematically tracking interactions and analyzing logs, developers can detect discrepancies, identify potential vulnerabilities, and ensure compliance with conservation principles. This section outlines strategies for real-time monitoring, log analysis, and auditing of MCP interactions, leveraging the **.MAML** protocol and the **PyTorch-SQLAlchemy-FastAPI** stack to support robust oversight in the quantum-resistant, multi-agent architecture of PROJECT DUNES.

### Real-Time Monitoring Setup
Real-time monitoring enables immediate detection of anomalies in MCP operations, ensuring that context conservation is maintained during active sessions. By visualizing key metrics and setting up automated alerts, developers can respond swiftly to issues that could compromise system integrity.

**Implementation Steps**:
1. **Deploy Monitoring Tools**: Use observability platforms like Prometheus and Grafana to create dashboards for real-time visualization of MCP metrics. Key metrics to monitor include:
   - **Token Efficiency**: Tracks the percentage of meaningful tokens used per session.
   - **Context Loss Rate**: Monitors the proportion of context lost or corrupted.
   - **Tool Call Success Rate**: Measures the reliability of tool invocations.
   - **API Call Volume**: Tracks the number of API calls per session to detect anomalies.
2. **Configure Data Sources**: Integrate the SQLAlchemy database (e.g., PostgreSQL) used for MCP logging with Prometheus. Use a Prometheus exporter to scrape metrics from the database:
   ```python
   from prometheus_client import Counter, Gauge
   from sqlalchemy import create_engine

   engine = create_engine('postgresql://user:pass@localhost/db')
   token_efficiency = Gauge('mcp_token_efficiency', 'Token efficiency percentage')
   context_loss = Gauge('mcp_context_loss', 'Context loss rate percentage')

   def update_metrics():
       with engine.connect() as conn:
           result = conn.execute("SELECT AVG(meaningful_tokens / total_tokens * 100) AS efficiency FROM mcp_logs")
           token_efficiency.set(result.fetchone()[0] or 0)
   ```
3. **Create Dashboards**: Build Grafana dashboards to display time-series data for each metric. For example, a line graph showing token efficiency over time can highlight trends or drops in performance.
4. **Set Alert Thresholds**: Configure alerts for deviations from target values (e.g., token efficiency <90%, context loss rate >2%). Use alerting tools like Alertmanager to notify developers via email or messaging platforms:
   ```yaml
   groups:
   - name: mcp_alerts
     rules:
     - alert: HighContextLoss
       expr: mcp_context_loss > 2
       for: 5m
       annotations:
         summary: "High context loss rate detected ({{ $value }}%)"
   ```

### Log Analysis for Conservation
Log analysis involves processing the data collected from MCP interactions to identify patterns, errors, or inefficiencies. By leveraging structured logs stored in the SQLAlchemy database, developers can quantify conservation metrics and diagnose issues that affect context integrity.

**Implementation Steps**:
1. **Query Logs for Metrics**: Use SQL queries to extract and analyze key metrics from the `mcp_logs` table. For example:
   ```sql
   SELECT
       session_id,
       AVG(meaningful_tokens / total_tokens * 100) AS token_efficiency,
       AVG(lost_tokens / total_tokens * 100) AS context_loss_rate,
       AVG(CASE WHEN tool_success THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100 AS tool_success_rate
   FROM mcp_logs
   GROUP BY session_id
   HAVING COUNT(*) > 0;
   ```
2. **Automate Analysis with Python**: Use libraries like `pandas` to process log data and compute metrics programmatically:
   ```python
   import pandas as pd
   from sqlalchemy import create_engine

   engine = create_engine('postgresql://user:pass@localhost/db')
   logs = pd.read_sql_table('mcp_logs', engine)
   efficiency = (logs['meaningful_tokens'] / logs['total_tokens'] * 100).mean()
   if efficiency < 90:
       print(f"Warning: Token efficiency ({efficiency:.2f}%) below target")
   ```
3. **Identify Anomalies**: Analyze logs for outliers, such as sessions with unusually high API call volumes or low tool success rates. For example, detect sessions with >100 API calls:
   ```python
   high_api_sessions = logs[logs['api_calls'] > 100][['session_id', 'api_calls']]
   if not high_api_sessions.empty:
       print("Anomaly: High API call volume detected", high_api_sessions)
   ```
4. **Schedule Regular Analysis**: Use a task scheduler like Celery to run log analysis scripts at regular intervals (e.g., hourly), ensuring continuous oversight.

### Auditing MCP Interactions
Auditing provides a formal process for verifying that MCP interactions adhere to quantitative conservation principles. By creating a comprehensive audit trail and conducting periodic reviews, developers can ensure system trustworthiness and compliance with security standards.

**Implementation Steps**:
1. **Enhance Audit Logs**: Extend the `mcp_logs` table to include audit-specific fields, such as user IDs, session outcomes, and context validation results:
   ```python
   from sqlalchemy import Column, Integer, String, DateTime, Boolean, JSON

   class MCPAuditLog(Base):
       __tablename__ = 'mcp_audit_logs'
       id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
       session_id = Column(String)
       user_id = Column(String)
       timestamp = Column(DateTime)
       context_valid = Column(Boolean)
       audit_metadata = Column(JSON)
   ```
2. **Conduct Periodic Audits**: Schedule audits (e.g., weekly) to review logs for compliance with conservation metrics. Use queries to identify sessions with issues:
   ```sql
   SELECT session_id, context_loss_rate
   FROM mcp_logs
   WHERE context_loss_rate > 2
   ORDER BY timestamp DESC;
   ```
3. **Generate Audit Reports**: Create detailed reports summarizing key metrics and findings. Use tools like Jupyter Notebook to generate visualizations:
   ```python
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

   plt.plot(logs['timestamp'], logs['token_efficiency'], label='Token Efficiency')
   plt.axhline(y=90, color='r', linestyle='--', label='Target')
   plt.title('MCP Token Efficiency Over Time')
   plt.legend()
   plt.savefig('audit_report_token_efficiency.png')
   ```
4. **Implement Corrective Actions**: Based on audit findings, adjust configurations (e.g., tighten rate limits, refine schemas) to address identified issues and improve conservation.

### Best Practices for Monitoring and Auditing
- **Granularity**: Ensure logs capture detailed metadata to support precise analysis and auditing.
- **Automation**: Automate monitoring and analysis processes to reduce manual effort and improve responsiveness.
- **Security**: Encrypt audit logs and restrict access using OAuth2.0-based role-based access control (RBAC) to protect sensitive data.
- **Retention**: Maintain logs for a defined period (e.g., 90 days) to balance auditability with storage efficiency, complying with data governance policies.
- **Transparency**: Share high-level audit summaries with stakeholders to build trust in the MCP’s conservation mechanisms.

### Performance Targets
The following table outlines target values for monitoring and auditing MCP interactions:

| Metric                  | Target Value       | Monitoring Frequency |
|-------------------------|--------------------|----------------------|
| Token Efficiency        | >90%              | Real-time            |
| Context Loss Rate       | <2%               | Hourly               |
| Tool Call Success Rate  | >98%              | Real-time            |
| API Call Volume         | 30–100 per session| Per session          |

By implementing these monitoring and auditing strategies, developers can ensure that the MCP maintains quantitative conservation, delivering reliable and secure AI interactions within the PROJECT DUNES ecosystem.
