# Quantum MCP for Dummies: Part 2 - Turning Your Computer into an MCP Router

Welcome back, quantum rookie! In Part 2 of *Quantum MCP for Dummies*, we’re turning your everyday computer into a **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** router, ready to handle quantum-parallel tasks with slick API functions. We’ll walk you through setting up your machine to talk to quantum servers, transforming it from a boring bilinear number-cruncher to a quadralinear superstar, with **PROJECT DUNES 2048-AES** as your guide. Let’s get that quantum router humming!

## What’s an MCP Router?

Think of the MCP as a super-smart librarian who knows exactly where to find quantum books in a cosmic library. An MCP router is your computer acting as a middleman, sending data to quantum servers (like IBM Quantum) via **APIs** and getting back answers that handle multiple variables at once. It’s part of **PROJECT DUNES 2048-AES**, which uses the **MAML protocol** to package data securely with 2048-bit AES encryption and CRYSTALS-Dilithium signatures.

Your computer, normally stuck in **bilinear mode** (processing two things, like input and output), becomes **quadrilinear**, juggling four or more variables—like traffic, weather, cost, and time—in one go, thanks to quantum parallelism.

## Setting Up Your MCP Router

Let’s get your computer ready. You’ll need:
1. **Python 3.8+** and **Qiskit** (install with `pip install qiskit`).
2. An **IBM Quantum API token** (sign up at quantum-computing.ibm.com).
3. A basic web server setup with **FastAPI** for API routing.

Install FastAPI:
```bash
pip install fastapi uvicorn
```

Here’s a simple MCP router script:
```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, IBMQ
app = FastAPI()
IBMQ.load_account()  # Uses your IBM Quantum API token

@app.get("/quantum-task")
def run_quantum_task():
    qc = QuantumCircuit(2)
    qc.h(0)  # Superposition
    qc.cx(0, 1)  # Entanglement
    qc.measure_all()
    provider = IBMQ.get_provider()
    backend = provider.get_backend('ibmq_qasm_simulator')
    result = backend.run(qc).result()
    return {"results": result.get_counts()}

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import uvicorn
    uvicorn.run(app, host="0.0.0.0", port=8000)
```

Run this with `uvicorn main:app --reload`, then visit `http://localhost:8000/quantum-task` to see quantum results. Your computer’s now routing quantum tasks!

## Bilinear to Quadralinear

Your old bilinear setup processes tasks one-by-one, like a to-do list. The MCP router, using quantum logic, handles multiple tasks in parallel. **Superposition** lets qubits try all possibilities at once, and **entanglement** links variables (e.g., cost and time) for quadralinear processing. **PROJECT DUNES**’ MAML files ensure these tasks are secure and executable.

## Why It’s Awesome

Your MCP router can optimize real-world problems—like delivery routes or stock trading—by processing multidimensional data instantly. With **PROJECT DUNES 2048-AES**, your data’s locked tight, and your computer’s a quantum gateway.
